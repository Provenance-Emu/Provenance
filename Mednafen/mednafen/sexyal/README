SexyAL current bugs and limitations:

	Only supports one input sample format right now:  SEXYAL_FMT_PCMS16

	Does not perform sample-rate conversion.

	The SDL driver is intended to be integrated in an application that already uses SDL, and calls SDL_Init()
	before a SexyAL device is opened, and SDL_Quit() after it is closed(the SexyAL SDL sound driver will handle
	initializing any SDL subsystems it needs if they're not already initialized, however).
	If you want to use it in an application that otherwise does not use SDL, you will need to set the environment
	variable "SEXYAL_SDL_STANDALONE" to a non-zero positive integer value before you open the SexyAL device.

	Pause() and Clear() are not completely implemented in drivers yet.

	CanWrite() semantics can be weird, read the comment in "sexyal.h".
