// CDAFR_Open(), and CDAFReader, will NOT take "ownership" of the Stream object(IE it won't ever delete it).  Though it does assume it has exclusive access
// to it for as long as the CDAFReader object exists.

// Don't allow exceptions to propagate into the vorbis/musepack/etc. libraries, as it could easily leave the state of the library's decoder "object" in an
// inconsistent state, which would cause all sorts of unfun when we try to destroy it while handling the exception farther up.
