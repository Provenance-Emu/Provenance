**Old TODO**:
************

The following games are broken to some extent:

Crystalis:		Mostly working, but the screen jumps around during
			dialogue.  It apparently resets the MMC3 IRQ counter
			mid-scanline.  It'll require low-level PPU and MMC3
			IRQ counter emulation to function properly.

Kickmaster:		IRQ occurs a few CPU cycles too late, interferes with NMI routine,
			and causes the game to lock up after the second boss.  Luckily, there
			are passwords, at least.
			*"FIXED" BY HACK*

Star Wars(PAL Beam Software version):
			MMC3 IRQ occurs when it shouldn't, similar to the problem in
			Kickmaster.
			*"FIXED" BY HACK*

*** Emulation:

 Figure out what mapper 113 really is.

 Sound frame count stuff on PAL games(is it correct?).
 
 Fix Zapper emulation(one version of Chiller still doesn't always work correctly).
