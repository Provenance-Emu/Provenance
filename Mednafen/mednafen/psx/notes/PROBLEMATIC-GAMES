-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of games that have been historically problematic and are likely to break easily on emulation model changes/screwups:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain Commando
	First stage's boss' graphics are all kinds of corrupt if CD sector buffering is incorrect(particularly in relation of GetLocL vs GetLocP vs raw
	sector data time fields).

Tekken 2
	Requires emulation of coprocessor(GTE)->CPU transfer delay slots, or else severe graphical glitching.

Skullmonkeys
	Requires correct load delay slot handling.

Next Tetris
	Requires proper GPU CLUT wrapping.

Threads of Fate
	Requires correctish CPU branch delay slot emulation(it has branch instructions in previous branch instructions' delay slots), otherwise lockups
	and graphical glitches.

Shadow Master
	Branches in branch delay slots.

Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver
	Uses clever DMA tricks, including linked-list DMA with blocks larger than the GPU FIFO size.

Final Fantasy 7
Final Fantasy 9
Chrono Cross
Dragon Quest 7
	Pause/resume linked-list DMA.

Battle Arena Toshinden
NBA Jam Extreme
Zero Divide
	Run too fast if CPU and(/or?) GPU operations execute too fast.  Probably not an issue anymore, but still
	listed here for reference.

iS: Internal Section
Arcade Party Pak (Toobin)
Next Tetris, The
	Extremely sensitive about interlacing semantics, especially in regards to the high bit of the GPU status register when entering
	interlaced 480-height mode.

X-Men Mutant Academy
	Sensitive to interlacing semantics and timing.

Ballblazer Champions
	Excessively sensitive to timing issues; might lock up during startup sometimes.

FIFA - Road to Worldcup 98 (USA)
	Used to lock up during startup; probably CPU instruction timing-related, or MDEC timing related,
	or CDC timing related, or DMA timing related, or maybe the moon phase is to blame!

	[CDC] WARNING: Interrupting command 0x02, phase=0, timeleft=1195 with command=0x02
	[CDC] Bad number(5) of args(first check) for command 0x02
	 0x39 0x23 0x22 0x41 0x67

Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana
	Used to suffer from random fairly long(but finite) freezes during gameplay.  Possibly CPU instruction-timing
	related.  Possibly CDC-timing related.

	[CDC] Command: ReadN --- 
	[CDC] Command: Standby --- 
	[CDC] Command: Nop --- 
	[CDC] Command: Setmode ---  0xa0
	[CDC] Command: Setloc ---  0x08 0x13 0x53

	[CDC] Command: Setloc ---  0x08 0x13 0x61
		0x800668B8

Resident Evil 2
	Lockup on second disc in a certain place; probably related to seek timing.  Seems to be fixed now, but still listed
	here for reference.

Nightmare Creatures
	Shoddy CD reading code that's unreasonably sensitive to CD access timings.  It's a wonder it even ever works on an actual
	PS1(my copy of it certainly doesn't).

Capcom games(MMX4, MMX5, etc)
	Sensitive about CD access and XA ADPCM timing(XA ADPCM early cutoff problems in early versions of Mednafen's PS1 emulation).

Viewpoint
	Extra-sensitive about GPU LL DMA timing.  (It was generating exceptions for some timings...)

Valkyrie Profile
	Battle scenes will go all kaka with no graphics updates if GPU LL DMA completes too soon.

Pro Pinball (series)
	Sensitive to correct interlace and draw line skipping emulation.

Dukes of Hazzard: Racing For Home
	Sensitive about the GPU busy status flag being set long enough; double-check if we ever make CPU emulation 
	more timing-accurate(the fix will likely just involve reducing the timing granularity for DMA and GPU updates).

Resident Evil - Director's Cut(non-Dual Shock-version)
	Controller configuration screen pops up on some screen transitions if timing is too far off and we're unlucky(all-timing issue, particularly
	CPU instruction timing and MDEC decode timing).

Parasite Eve II
	Early 3D-models-on-top-of-FMV sequence with police cars outside building is a jerky mess if MDEC timing/overall throughput is too far off.

Wing Commander 3 and 4
	Will quasi-randomly lock up during FMVs if SeekL completes too fast.

Cybersled (Japan)
	Reads too many bytes from CDC results FIFO, causing wraparound(and will lock up if the "wrong" values are present in the FIFO's memory).

This Is Football 2
	Relies on resetting Mode parameter to correct value on Reset CDC command execution.

Harukanaru Toki no Naka de - Banjou Yuugi (Japan)
	Locks up if GetLocL vs ReadS isn't emulated properly.

Gran Turismo
	No music if GetLocL vs ReadS vs Reading/Seeking status bits aren't emulated properly.

MLB 99
	Crashes during startup in 0.9.37.1, started working in 0.9.38; possibly CD Read*/Seek timing related?

Wu-Tang - Shaolin Style
	Requires proper handling of the case of CD-DA playing into the leadout area.

Tomb Raider
	Relies on low-level CD drive behavior in regards to Q subchannel data(read via GetlocP) after a SeekP.
