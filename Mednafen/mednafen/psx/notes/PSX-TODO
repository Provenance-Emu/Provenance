***Major issues***

Cyberwar (Japan)
	Locks up during startup(SPU status bits issue).

Monkey Hero
	Locks up shortly after title screen.  It's straddling a framebuffer write command's parameters across two linked-list
	blocks(2 words at the end of the first block, and 1 word at the beginning of the next block).  AFAIK, this construct will only
	work on the real thing under *very* strict timing constraints.  Probably explains why it reportedly doesn't work on the PS2.
	It's as easy to fix as changing a certain 2 to a 3 in the GPU command table, and probably won't break anything,
	but I'm still reluctant to do it...

Simple 1500 Series Vol. 057 - The Maze
	Locks up during startup;  looks to be poorly programmed and extremely sensitive to seek timing.

Transformers - Beast Wars Transmetals
	Locks up during loading screen. (CD timing issue)
	It looks like a terrible game though, at least.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Medium issues***

Championship Motocross 2001
	Invisible driver.  GHOSTRIDER~  The palette data in RAM is apparently being selectively zero'd out between
	the DMA from CDC and the DMA to GPU for some reason.  Timing issue related maybe?  (Probably CPU instruction timing issue)

International Moto X (Japan)
	Flickering/Missing graphics on racer selection screen.

Nicktoons Racing
	Totally fubared sound effects.  Likely CPU instruction timing-related(decreasing the IPC fixes this problem), or perhaps timing
	related to SPU RAM writes?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Lesser issues***

Vigilante 8
	Has weird red and green(and a few blue) garbage pixels in patches sometimes during gameplay.

Sangokushi Eiketsuden
	Many animations go far too fast(It *looks* like the GPU's drawing speed dictates the animation speed!  That means the animation speed is going
	to be different on early PS1s compared to later PS1s...).

Final Fantasy 7
	"Sony Computer blah blah" game startup image is a bit glitchy; interlacing-related glitch.  That part is really sensitive to CPU, GPU, DMA,
	and RAM timing...

Nightmare Creatures
	BIOS reverb sound excessively contaminates beginning of game.

WipeOut 3
	Music stops playing after a long while; maybe it's supposed to do that?

Rascal
	Flickering/missing graphics in menus.

T'ai Fu - Wrath of the Tiger
	Sometimes locks up when starting a new game.

Differentiate between power-on and reset-button events more accurately(e.g. in CPU and GTE code).

Handle D28 of DMA CHCR properly.

Rewrite CPU emulation to properly emulate the pipeline and all its quirks(might be too computationally-expensive, though).  Related TODOs
dependent on this:
	Audit GTE instruction cycle counts.
	Test IRQ and COP0 latencies; PSX IRQ controller latency, software IRQ bit latency, latency of both relevant COP0 IRQ enable bits.
	Test IRQ with LWC2.
	Test IRQ with COP0 instructions(interrupted execution or not?).

CDC status bit 4(seek error/disc change/something something) semantics aren't entirely correct; run tests to see under what conditions
the bit is cleared(e.g. what commands will clear it).

Add a means of grabbing and passing CIRC data, when using a physical CD, from Mednafen core to the PSX module so that the correct
subheader fields can be chosen when there is a mismatch between the two instances of each field during XA ADPCM playback.

Ensure(long-term, IE a note to the FUTURE) that input device state is latched in independent variables at the start of the
input device's handling of a state read command, so that when games are reading device state across an MDFNI_Emulate() boundary, the
data won't change in the middle, which could hypothetically cause problems in some rare circumstances(and make entering 
button combos in games more finicky).

Respect device(GPU, SPU, etc.) DMA mode/memory access mode bits(more for homebrew's sake than commercial games'). 

Test if Dual Analog vibration compatibility mode can be restored with DualShock after using DualShock extended features if the "Analog"
mode button on the gamepad is pressed after the extended features are used.

The SPU in the PS1 might sometimes drop voice-on events when playing an ADPCM block that loops to itself(and was also the first and only
ADPCM block, at least in the test program I noticed the issue in); investigate further.

Ensure debugger COPn disassembly is correct(no typos or whatnot).
