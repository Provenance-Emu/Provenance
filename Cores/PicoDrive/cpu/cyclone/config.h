 * MEMHANDLERS_NEED_PC updates .pc context field with PC value effective at the time
 * when memhandler was called (opcode address + 2-10 bytes).
 * MEMHANDLERS_NEED_PREV_PC updates .prev_pc context field to currently executed
 * opcode address + 2.
 * Note that .pc and .prev_pc values are always real pointers to memory, so you must
 * subtract .membase to get M68k PC value.

 * Warning: updating PC in memhandlers is dangerous, as Cyclone may internally
 * increment the PC before fetching the next instruction and continue executing
 * at wrong location. It's better to wait until Cyclone CycloneRun() finishes.
 *
 * Warning: if you enable MEMHANDLERS_CHANGE_CYCLES, you must also enable
 * MEMHANDLERS_NEED_CYCLES, or else Cyclone will keep reloading the same cycle
 * count and this will screw timing (if not cause a deadlock).
