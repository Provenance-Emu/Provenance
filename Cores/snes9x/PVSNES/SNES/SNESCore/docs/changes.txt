1.39mk3

- Honkaku Syogi Fuunji Ryuou (J) fixed (force no multitap)  (Frank Yang)
  Also Fixed Super Castles (j).
  Also fixed a bunch more. This dude e-mailed like 100 bugs
  to my hosts, some already fixed in Snes9x1.39mk2, but
  about 7 were clearly multi-tap5.
- also fixed Dekitate High School. Error was in Japanese    (Frank Yang, Tomato)
- fixed 2 memory leaks                                      (Aaron)

  Thanks neviksti, The Dumper, TRAC, and FatlXception
  for clarifying the behavior.
- Fixed Sailor Moon Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2 to work with          (neviksti, MKendora)
  previous fix. It's a total hack, but it should sound
  just like the old Snes9x did.	neviksti strikes again!
- Dirty hack to make 3 games deinterleave properly:         (MKendora)
  Wizardry 4, Mark Davis, and Honkakuha Igo Gosei(FX)
  all work as well as the deinterleaved counterparts.
  (The last is a hacked game, and you should get the
  non-FX version)
- Fixed Seima Jyuden Beasts and Blades. Another Multitap,   (Frank Yang)
  but for some reason, the hack requires the C cpu core.
  Thanks to Tomato for taking a stab at the error message,
  as well. It was too vague to be of use, he said. I
  just tried it because it worked on other games.
- Res Arcana fixed. Another Frank Yang report, another J    (Frank Yang, MKendora)
  error, but I can read kana well enough with a table!
- Removed a Terranigma specific hack. Not sure, but the     (anomie)
  new behavior might have fixed Tin-Tin in Tibet's colors.
- Dirty hack to work around a dirty hack. Both Yoshi's      (MKendora)
  Island (E) dumps should work now
- Added the JumboLoROM memory map, Extends LoROM support    (The Dumper, neviksti, MKendora)
  to 48+ Megabits.

- fixed Orge Battle's green lines. (CPU source for DMA)     (anomie)
  - Looks interesting, and might apply to other DMA cases?
- maybe "fixed" DKC's barrels? by treating $2001
   as unmapped. The game worked before with a hack.         (MKendora)
- optimized SPC7110 slightly by removing extra setup work   (MKendora)
- Fixed DBZ 3 (Korean). S. Korea is, in fact, NTSC.         (MKendora)

  - some companies aren't in the table I used.
    If you encounter an Unimplemented company,
    report it the the Snes9x development forum, with
    the correct company and the number.


1.39mk
- SPC7110 support based on Dark Force's docs.               (Dark Force, zsKnight,
                                                             The Dumper, MKendora)
  Trust me when I say those guys deserve the credit more
  than me. From what I'm told, Dark Force is the man
  behind most of the reverse engineering, but they all
  did a much harder bunch of work than I did following
  their specs. It's plain and simple that these three
  are the masterminds behind all SPC7110 support.

  Dark Force for reverse engineering the chip (Extremely tough work!)
  zsKnight for the original core, and probably other things
  The Dumper for dumping the packs and doing hardware tests.

  Also thanks to CaitSith2 for numerous bug reports
  and a lot of bug fixes.

  so only Marko's Magic Football is intentionally fixed.    (anomie)
- finished zsnes save support, though I don't know how
  well it will work with SPC7110 games                      (MKendora)
- Added a new soundux.cpp again to fix some noise.
  (Fixes the GW "fart track")                               (Lord Nightmare, info from Anti-Res)
- Added 3 cache modes for SPC7110 games                     (MKendora)

  and the Anti-Res decoder be disabled.                     (FatlXception, port by Lord Nightmare)
- Added CaitSith2's RTC debugger. define RTC_DEBUGGER in
  project settings to enable it.                            (CaitSith2)
- SPC7110 per-game cumulative logging                       (MKendora)

- "I'm not worthy" thanks to the original SPC7110 crew (DF, zsKnight, and the Dumper)
- Thanks again to the same people, because they deserve it!
- thanks to The Dumper, Dejap, TRAC, and all the ZSNES crew for technical assistance
- Thanks to most of the Snes9x mods for testing (no thanks to you, Raptor ;)
- and thanks to TRAC and #mkendora for letting me vent at you.

1.39
- Added SDD-1 unknown graphics data logging at the dumper's request. A bit late
  but might help with Street Fighter 2 Alpha's data dumping. Creates a
  romname.dat file in the freeze file folder.
- Implemented 16-bit texture support for OpenGL modes in Windows and Linux.
  Had to support a new pixel format type to do it - RGB5551 (one bit of alpha)
  which caused me some major problems - black was no longer always pixel value
  zero!
- Removed the Bump map OpenGL mode from the Windows port (didn't look so good
  anyway and was slow).
- Added a hidden novelty OpenGL mode (clue: a keyboard shortcut activates it)
- Reverted back to FMod version 3.20 after reports that version 3.33 broke
  AD3 support.
- Implemented a better work-around for the broken select system call in the
  Linux kernel - the original work-around was long-winded and stopped working
  when I implemented OpenGL support under Linux.
- Added the same speed-up hack to the OpenGL code that the Glide code already
  supported. Basically, if your OpenGL implementation supports 16-bit textures
  then OpenGL mode should be as fast, or faster than the 3dfx Glide mode.
- Hopefully fixed Glide support.
- Reverted back to the original colour blending code. The newer code, although
  more accurate in most cases, had too many glitches and was slower.
- Included multiple Japanese games fixes from Iswashi San.
- Fixed a timing problem caused by a speed up hack that was affecting Top Gear
  300. No the game still isn't playable yet, but I noticed the problem while
  investigating the DSP-4 chip used by the game.
1.38
- Added support for Star Ocean and Street Fighter 2 Alpha decompressed graphics
  packs from dejap. Used a binary chop search rather than a linear search to
  locate correct decompressed graphics more quickly - should help emulation
  speed during later stages of the game.
- Included OpenGL support into the Linux port and speeded up the Windows OpenGL
  implementation slightly. The real speed up would occur if I could figure out
  how/if 16-bit textures are supported in OpenGL because at the moment the
  16-bit software rendered SNES image must be converted to 24-bit before being
  uploaded as a texture...
- Included the latest ZSNES DSP-1 code. Now Pilotwings, SD Racer and Suzuka 8
  Hours are playable. Aim For The Ace, Super Air Diver 1 & 2 and Syutoko Battle 94
  are also playable, but with bugs. Thanks to zsKnight, _demo_, et al for all
  their hard work.
- Another Daffy Duck: Marvin Missions screen flicker problem worked around -
  writing to the IRQ enable register shouldn't clear any pending IRQs, but
  Sieken 3 seems to require this or else the game hangs. Special-cased Daffy
  Duck for now.
- An NMI emulation bug was triggering a Panic Bomberman World game bug,
  crashing it. Basically, if a game enables NMIs after the normal trigger
  point, the NMI should not trigger if the game has already read the NMI clear
  register.
- Panic Bomberman World requires SPC700 memory to be initialised to zero on
  reset otherwise the game hangs when a tune finishes and another one should
  start.
- Added mouse pointer auto-hide to the Windows port. Much better than the turn
  the mouse pointer into a black dot method I was using before.
- Included the latest ZSNES Super FX code. Not sure if it fixes actually fixes
  any games.
- Added an offset hack for Strike Gunner to get the scrolling ground layer
  to line up correctly - another offset-per-tile bug hacked around for now.
- Arrr! Left in some debugging code in the last release that prevented all
  games that need the slower SPC700 timing from working. Removed it.
- Hmm. The broken cut-scenes in Deep Space 9 seem to indicate that I haven't
  got the emulated clock speed of the 65c816 CPU correct yet. And not by a
  little bit - a 9% too slow error. Hacked special timing for the game for now.
- Added triple-buffering to Windows port - enabling double-buffering actually
  enables triple-buffering if you have enough free video RAM, defaulting to
  double-buffering if you don't.
- Fixed another crash bug in the interpolated mode 7 code - if no scaling
  was being used (either up or down) and screen repeat was enabled and the
  screen was flipped horizontally, the routine would crash Snes9x. Was causing
  Snes9x to crash during rock monster boss stage of Castlevania 4.
- Oops. Got the initialisation of the default SNES screen width and height
  round the wrong way - could cause a X Windows System error message on the
  UNIX port after loading a ZSNES freeze file.
- Included the unofficial Windows port emulation fixes for several games including
  Kentouou World championship and TKO Super Championship.
- Included Iwashi San's improved Anti Res. sound sample decoding routine and
  updated the C version to match.
- Included Anti Res. improved sample decompression code he sent me ages ago,
  but for some reason I didn't include. Sorry. This version seems good enough
  to leave enabled all the time.
1.37
- Added fix for Captain America's corrupt graphics - a ROM bug causes it to
  read from what I thought should be an unmapped memory area, but it expects
  the value returned to be zero.
- Added code to support games that switch to the hi-res. SNES screen mode part
  way down the screen while using the 3dfx bi-linear filter mode. The code
  basically has to back out of the speed up hack it was using when the game
  switches resolutions.
- Fixed support for games that have mixed lo-res. (256x224), medium res.
  (512x224) and hi-res. (512x448) all on the same screen - corrects the display
  of Majin Tensei 2.
- Added support for games that use sub-screen addition to the back-drop layer
  while displaying hi-res. graphics - something I thought the SNES couldn't do
  but the game Marvelous uses this.
- Reworked the UNIX/Linux output image handling code: the image doesn't always
  have to be scaled when hi-res. support is enabled, the PutImage operation
  only updates the area of the screen it has to, the SNES image is now always
  centred in the window/full-screen area and if the SNES image changes size
  between frames, the old screen areas are now correctly cleared.
- Fixed the corrupt graphics problem during the battle scene of Last Bible 3 -
  it requires that previously unknown DMA mode 5 should just act the same as
  DMA mode 1.
- Fixed a nasty bug when H-IRQs were being reused on the same scanline - a logic
  bug could cause H-DMA processing for that line to be skipped. Was causing
  the bridge and the start banners to be the wrong colours in Top Gear 2.
- Added Kreed's display processing modes to the Linux port, including his new
  asm version of the Super2xSaI mode and the new software bi-linear filtering
  mode.
- Think I might have figured out the odd Mode 7 glitch problems the games
  Illusion and Gaia and Chase HQ were having. My original fix was to mod the
  centre X & Y values with 1024, but looks like the true fix is to mod
  X + horizontal offset and Y + vertical offset with 1024 when screen wrapping
  is enabled.
- Disabled H-DMA'ing into V-RAM via registers 2118/2119. The game Hook
  deliberately does this causing graphic corruption while dialog boxes are
  displayed. Maybe the real SNES disallowed this and it was left in the game by
  mistake? Not sure what effect the game was trying to produce because
  disabling the emulation of this feature doesn't seem to affect the game at
  all, other than stopping the corruption.
   + Also fixes graphics junk problem on first screen of Bugs Bunny.
- Added a 'region-free' timing hack for Power Rangers Fight - without it the
  NTSC version was displaying badly glitching graphics; I'd already fixed the
  PAL version.
- Added true priority-per-pixel mode 7 support (the previous support was just
  a hack to get the colours correct) - level 2 of Contra 3 used this feature.
- The Japanese, German, French and Spanish version of Illusion of Gaia needs the
  slow SPC700 timing.
- Deleted the Breath of Fire 2 S-RAM hack for the hacker intro version -
  according to reports it was causing problems for the non-hacked version.
- Legend, the PAL version, never sets the sound master volume control - Snes9x
  was defaulting this to off, I guess the real SNES must default it to full
  volume; changed Snes9x. The NTSC version of Legend does set the master
  volume level, but sets it to off just after the title screen. Hmm. The -nmv
  command-line switch allows you to hear sound in this version.
- Panic Bomber World was tripping an SA-1 emulation bug - the WAI instruction
  emulation code was setting the 'waiting for interrupt' flag on the wrong CPU
  causing the main SNES to skip an instruction when the next interrupt occurred.
- Panic Bomber World, Bomberman 4 and UFO Kamen Yakisoban all need the slower
  SPC700 timing.
- Oops! The Super Formation Soccer 95 fix was causing Aero 2 to lock up. This
  means I have no no idea what value the DMA in progress register should
  represent. I've hacked it and made it toggle between 0 and $ff on each read
  which gets both games working, for now...
- The ROM de-interleaving code always assumed the blocks were rearranged based
  on a power of two, but Francois found a copy of Soldiers of Fortune where
  this was not the case. Corrected the code.
1.36
- Finally worked out why the menu items weren't being highlighted in several
  ROMs, including Battletoads, U.N. Squadron and All Japan Pro Wrestling.
  Two problems: its seems the SNES does halve the colour value result when
  blending colours when only the fixed colour addition/subtraction is enabled,
  but doesn't halve the result when sub-screen is being blended and its a clear
  part of the sub-screen. The second problem was that I had an optimisation
  that prevented the time consuming colour blending code from being called if
  the colour being added/subtracted was black - adding zero to a number doesn't
  affect the result, but not performing the side-effect of halving the result
  does affect the final value...
- Super Formation Soccer 95 requires that the DMA enabled register doesn't
  always return zero, otherwise the game locks up.
- Thanks to several people reporting a screen flickering problem in the
  pseudo 3-d section of Jurassic Park 2 I've fixed a nasty problem in H-IRQ
  handling code which could cause double-triggers or skip IRQs altogether.
  With this fix I can now remove the special hacks for Ninja Warriors Again,
  Chuck Rock and F-1 Grand Prix.
- More games needing the slow SPC700 timing:
  Zennihon Puroresu 2, Soulblazer and Robotrek.
- The CPU idle time skipping code was skipping cycles during a software delay
  loop in Itchy and Scratchy, causing screen flicker.
- Looks like reading the value of register $2137 shouldn't clear a pending
  IRQ - was causing screen flicker on Yoshi's Island.
- Actraiser 1 & 2 both need the slow SPC700 timing.
- Terranigma reads a sound channel's current sample output value and waits for
  it to be zero before preceeding. I forgot to always return zero when a
  channel was silent. This mistake was causing the game to lock up.
   + Itchy and Scratchy and was causing the music to stop and samples to be cut
     short in the Mario Early Years series.
- Added a hack for Secret of the Evermore - at several points in the game, just
  as the plane is about to land, it reads from unknown registers $4000 and
  $4001 and, if it doesn't get the value its looking for, the game hangs or
  displays corrupt graphics.
- Silva Saga 2 was accidentally triggering a colour blending hack I put in
  place Kirby Dreamland 3 and Kirby Superstar.
- The ZSNES freeze-file loading code could leave a file open if the file wasn't
  a valid ZSNES freeze file.
- Super Punch-out requires certain DMA registers to be updated after the DMA
  completes. Snes9x used to do that, but I must have accidentally left the code
  commented out whilst investigating a different problem in another game.
1.35
- Added a recently played game list to the Windows port File menu so you can
  quickly load up your favourite games.
- Included IPS patching support based on code from Neill Corlett - just rename
  the patch file to match your ROM image name but with a .ips extension and
  copy it into your ROM or freeze-file folder.
- Added John Weidman's and Darkforce's S-RTC, (Real Time Clock) emulation code.
  The only game that seems to use it is Dai Kaijyu Monogatari II.
- Included code from Nose000 for games with 128Kbytes of S-RAM. Now
  Sound Novel-Tcool, Thoroughbred Breeder 3, RPG-Tcool 2 and Dezaemon are
  supported.
- The Windows port now has an option to make the 'turbo speed' button a toggle
  button.
- The optimised fixed colour addition/subtraction code was ignoring the colour
  window. Thanks to John Weidman for pointing this out.
- Added mode 7 and hi-res. hack for Dezaemon from Nose000 - the mode 7 hack
  looks interesting (to me); I wonder if some other games would benefit?
- Both Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean need custom sound CPU timing. Hmm.
  That's 4 ROMs now, there will be more... That means I still haven't
  discovered all the major SNES timing quirks. :-(
- Windows port now has an option to save the S-RAM data at any time.
- Windows port saving SPC dumps now auto-increments the filename.
- Added work-around for a Super Robot Wars Ex ROM bug - the game was checking
  the wrong PPU register for end of h-blank. The game must have only worked by
  chance rather than by design on a real SNES.
1.34
- Corrected the colour addition/subtraction and halve the result code not to
  halve the result when only the fixed colour is used, i.e. the sub-screen is
  clear. Discovered and fixed this awhile ago, but I accidentally reintroduced
  the bug when adding some optimisations a few versions back.
- Finally cleared the last of the offset per tile background mode bugs. There
  was something odd about the tile at the left-hand edge of the screen that I
  couldn't figure out - well now I have. Yoshi's Island level 6 boss screen,
  Mario RPG mine cart screen and Jim Power title screen now all display
  correctly.
- Made reading blank areas of the SNES memory map return the middle byte of
  the address - fixes Home Alone which tries to execute code in an empty part
  of its memory map but only works because the real SNES seems to return the
  middle byte of the address - $60 in this case, which corresponds to the
  ReTurn from Subroutine instruction.
- Added auto-cycle skipping disable for Earth Worm Jim 2 and several other
  games that spool sample data using H-DMA as the sample is being played.
  Improves some sound effects in these games.
- Fixed joy-pad routines to only report up or left if down or right are also
  pressed respectively. Works around a game bug in Empire Strikes Back in the
  asteroid stage where the game crashes if both left and right are pressed -
  something impossible to do on the original SNES game-pad.
- Added custom SPC700 timing for Rendering Ranger R2 - the game now works with
  full sound. No idea why it needs custom SPC700 timing.
- The ROM type detection was broken for Treasure Hunter G and Test Drive 2 -
  fixed the code so type 2 ROMs can be LoROM.
- Adjusted the main CPU cycles per scan-line from 341 to 342 to give an exact
  match for the timing required for Earth Worm Jim 2. All EWJ2 needs now
  for perfect sound emulation is a method of synchronising the emulation
  speed to the host hardware's sound card playback rate, oh, and a fast CPU!
  The Linux port already has this but seems to be broken because games
  play at double-speed when this option is enabled.
- Some SPC700 code in Earth Worm Jim 2 seemed to prove that I had guessed the
  clock speed of the SPC700 sound CPU incorrectly - out by almost a factor of
  two, in fact. Changed the relative emulated clock speed of SPC700. Now
  Chrono Trigger doesn't lock up at certain points anymore, the special SPC700
  timing for games written by the Human Software company isn't required and
  you can hear some more of the sound samples in Earth Worm Jim 2, etc.
- H-IRQ triggering code was broken - if a ROM turned on H-IRQ but later turned
  it off, Snes9x could continued to generate H-IRQs, crashing some games.
- Added a generic test for Human Entertainment games - they need special
  sound CPU timing to work. Gets Taekwon-Do working.
- Disabled offset-per-tile mode for Theme Park; the world map screen is corrupt
  with it enabled.
- Yet more changes to the offset-per-tile backgrounds modes 2 and 4. Added
  64 tile wide screen support for Mario RPG's mine cart ride and fixed multiple
  bugs with the handling of horizontal offset-per-tile used in Chrono Trigger's
  fade in of the space ship.
- New feature: Snes9x can now load ZSNES freeze state files! Just copy them
  into the freeze file folder and Snes9x will load them when you load a freeze
  file, but only if the corresponding native format Snes9x freeze file doesn't
  exist.
- Added memory map hack for Batman - Revenge of the Joker: its ROM header block
  is in the wrong location and Snes9x incorrectly detected its ROM type.
- Fixed an off-by-one-pixel clip window 2 bug when the window was set to clip
  outside the window area; clip window 1 was already correct. Removed the bright
  line bug at the left edge when the combat screen is appearing in Starfox and
  the clip problem when text boxes zoom-out in Yoshi's Island.
- Jim Power's title screen seems to prove that the per-tile offset data on
  mode 2 isn't ignored for the left most tile as I originally thought.
  Modified the code.
- The recent timing changes highlighted another problem with Daffy Duck -
  changed IRQ enable register to only clear pending IRQs if one has been pending
  for several microseconds.
- Speeded up the sprite data register handling slightly.
- Finally got Aero the AcroBat 2 working, after many hours of investigation,
  spread over several years - literally! Two problems. The SNES doesn't seem
  to consider scan-line line zero to be part of the v-blank period even though
  the line is never drawn and V-IRQs at the start of the scan-line have to be
  delayed until a few microseconds into the line - Traverse: Starlight & Prairie
  required this as well, so I removed the original, Traverse specific hack.
  There's a problem with the in-game music that I'll investigate at a later
  date.
  - The in-game music problem just required ENVX emulation to be switched on,
    off by default on the Linux port, on by default on the Windows port.
- Fixed the mode 7 corruption problem on the title screen of Chase HQ using the
  same trick as Illusion of Gaia - i.e. mod the mode 7 centre X & Y values with
  1024.
- Fixed another crash bug in the interpolated mode 7 code - a portion of
  the code was ignoring the screen flip value and the fact that X render
  direction reversed if the screen was flipped horizontally. Was causing a
  crash on the whale boss screen of Kirby Superstar.
- Mortal Kombat 3 now auto-adjusts emulated cycles per scan-line work-around
  a speech sample being cut short.
- Added sample data register reading support to the sound DSP - somehow I
  seem to have missed implementing this. Not sure if any ROM actually reads
  the value.
- Followed Sumire Kinoshita's suggestion and stopped clearing the ENDX flags
  when the value is read, against my better judgement, and it does actually
  improve speech samples in several games. Ooops! The Mortal Kombat series,
  Magical Drop 2 and Metal Combat are the ones I've discovered so far.
- WWF Arcade now auto-adjusts the cycles per scan-line value to work-around
  a sound sample repeat problem.
- Hmm. There's something about offset-per-tile mode I don't understand - WWF
  Wrestlemania Arcade is getting corrupt graphics; not sure what effect the
  ROM is trying to produce. Disabled offset-per-tile mode for the game for now.
- Fixed Street Racer player 1 wobble problem during the soccer game by auto-
  adjusting the cycles per scan-line value slightly.
- Made Power Rangers Fight auto-adjust emulated cycles per scan-line to work
  around a slight timing problem that causes an NMI to corrupt register
  values that an IRQ handler is trying to update. Without it the scrolling
  back-drop and fighter graphics are corrupt.
- Illusion of Gaia seems to need the mode 7 centre X & Y values to be mod 1024
  if the screen repeat flag is set. Fixes the island fly-over bug right at
  the end of the intro but breaks a few other games. Hmm. Made it auto-switch
  on for this game only.
- Added memory map support for Radical Dreamers. Thanks to satellite hut master
  for the information.
- Made updates to the top bit of the sprite write address register be ignored
  unless the low byte had been written to first. A ROM coding bug in
  James Pond II requires this, otherwise it writes a junk byte value into the
  main character's X position and Robocod wobbles around all over the place.
- Reverted back to pre 1.31 way of initialising unknown register values -
  Rock and Roll Racing was reading a junk register value and using the value
  to set up DMA, which in turn was causing corruption on the player select
  screen.
- Added Star Ocean memory map - thanks zsKnight! The original ROM I was testing
  was corrupt, no wonder I couldn't figure out the memory map myself! The game
  still isn't playable, though, due to missing S-DD1 graphics decompression
  (+ encryption?) emulation.
- Started to dump some compressed data values from Street Fighter 2 Alpha in
  the hope that one day someone will be able to crack the S-DD1's compression
  algorithm.
1.33a
- C4 emulation wasn't being automatically enabled for Rockman X2 / X3 - the
  Japanese versions of Megaman X2 / X3.
- Fixed the Super FX plot table pointer that I accidentally broke while saving
  1Mb of workspace RAM - it was stopping all Super FX games from working.
1.33
- Noticed another problem with the CPU_SHUTDOWN code - Chrono Trigger locked
  up during the intro but only when using the asm code CPU core. Found the
  algorithm difference between the code and made the CPU match what the C
  version was doing. Still not sure why it caused a problem in the first place.
- Changed colour subtraction code to use Lindsey Dubb's newer version he sent
  me some time ago but I 'forgot' to include. I say forgot, but I really put
  off including it because, although it improves most games that use the
  effect, it does result in one or two slight visual glitches.
- Hacked in zsKnight's C4 emulation asm code - now both Megaman X2 and X3 are
  playable. Still got to complete the reverse engineering of the i386 asm code
  to C so other, non-Intel ports can have C4 emulation.
- Shuffled the keyboard mapping a bit on the Linux port so now Tab key acts as
  an emulation speed turbo button, `, # and ~ act as superscope turbo and
  / acts as the superscope pause button.
- Fixed asm CPU_SHUTDOWN code that I accidentally broke while trying to
  optimise it! Thanks to all the people who noticed Snes9x's frame skipping
  had changed between releases. Frames rates should be improved again for more
  than 50% of games.
- Re-enabled in-lining of the C SNES memory access routines, improves frame
  rate by one or two on slower machines.
- Optimised the asm 65c816 addressing mode emulation code a little.
- Included some code changes making life easier for the Mac porter, John Stiles.
- Added memory map support for Sufami Turbo using information supplied by
  Nose0000. No idea if it works because I don't have the ROM.
- Spent a few minutes trying to figure out the Star Ocean memory map so at
  least the sound effects could be heard. But gave up after a couple of hours
  due to laziness. If anyone knows the memory map details, let me know please!
1.32a
- The delay loading of the OpenGL DLLs on the Windows port was causing the
  OpenGL initialisation code to fail. Reverted back to normal DDL loading but
  with the side effect that Windows 95 users must visit the Microsoft web site
  and download the OpenGL add-on before Snes9x will work for them.
- Corrected the OpenGL bump-map display option - my attempt to get the
  bi-linear OpenGL display option to work with Voodoo card's limited texture
  size had broken the bump-map mode.
1.32
- Changed the Windows port to delay load the two OpenGL DLLs, so now they're
  only loaded if you switch to OpenGL mode. The original version of Windows 95
  didn't include the OpenGL DDLs, so Snes9x wouldn't even start on that
  platform; now it should.
- Added yet another sound buffer option to the Windows port - this time the
  block size of sound data to mix. Some DirectSound sound card drivers only
  report the play position moving in steps rather than continuous amounts and
  Snes9x's default mix block size turned out to be smaller than this step
  value on several cards.
  Snes9x couldn't work out out where the true play position was accurately
  enough resulting in broken, noisy sound output.
- Modified the Windows frame timer code to use semaphores rather than events -
  they should make Snes9x more reliable at not missing frame sync pulses when
  Windows is busy doing background tasks.
- Added SA-1 shutdown code - basically, Snes9x now stops emulating SA-1 CPU
  instructions when the SA-1 enters an idle loop waiting for the main SNES
  CPU to give it something to do. All SA-1 run much faster and smoother now.
- Added multi-axis joystick/game controller support to the Windows port and
  tweaked the dead-zone threshold position a little.
- It looks like the SNES PPU was designed to support 128K of V-RAM but only
  64K was fitted; Snes9x wasn't wrapping all V-RAM address to stay within the
  64K limit causing a corrupt title screen on ReX Ronan - there will be others.
- Added amend functionality to the Windows Cheat Entry dialog and added extra
  text boxes for direct address and cheat value input rather than only being
  able to type in a Game Genie or Pro-Action Reply code.
- BS Suttehakkun2 was crashing just before start of play - the ROM was
  performing a junk DMA that was corrupting RAM, crashing the game when it
  went searching for a particular value.
- F-1 Grand Prix requires IRQ triggering when IRQ scan-line register set to
  current scan line, but Chuck Rock objects. Hmm. Chuck Rock seems to indicate
  the CPU emulation is running too fast, but I can't see where the mistake is.
  Special-cased Chuck Rock for now.
- Optimised SNES DMA handling slightly - copying data to SNES V-RAM is now
  significantly faster.
- Windows Cheat search dialog was ignoring data type parameter in various
  places which was causing problems when larger numbers were being searched
  for.
- Forced unknown PPU register reads to always return 0 - a coding bug in
  Equinox shows that this is required. An earlier fix didn't work.
- Puya Puya 2 & remix were objecting to an NMI being triggered when enabling
  NMIs after scan-line 226, but Ys 5 seems to require this. Hmm. Added a hack
  to support both games.
1.31
- Snes9x DirectSound code modified - the mixing block size is now always 10ms
  for Windows 95/98/2000 and 20ms for NT 4.x, now there should be no need to
  enable Sync Sound when a large sound buffer is required (helps emulation
  speed). The maximum sound buffer length values have been updated to reflect
  the smaller mixing block size.
- Changed the DirectSound code back to use an offset from the play position
  as the place to write new sample data into the sound buffer - on NT 4.x the
  write position seems to vary randomly rather than being a fixed distance
  in front of the play position as documented. Now I know why I used the play
  position originally!
- Changed the DirectSound code to fill the sound buffer at the write position
  supplied by DirectSound, rather than just before the current play position -
  should help reduce latency.
- Added an auto-detect method for interleaved mode 2 Super FX ROM images -
  well, not really auto-detect: if the game crashes and its a Super FX game,
  Snes9x assumes its in interleaved mode 2, de-mangles the ROM image and tries
  to run the game again.
- Had to update the Snes9x Windows registry version number as the additional
  diagonal settings make old registry settings incompatible.
- Added diagonal keyboard controls to the Windows port, as requested by
  several users.
- Changed PPU code to return zero when reading non-existent registers - the
  game Equinox relies on this due to an original game coding bug.
- Included FMOD sound driver support to Windows port - people experiencing
  broken sound or delayed sound, etc, might want to give it a try.
- Tales of Phantasia - un-interleaved format ROM memory map changes to match
  odd ZSNES format, now the hacked ROM works.
- Changed NMI again. Made reading or writing to PPU register 0x4210
  clear NMI pending flag again, without this Super Tennis does not work.
- Changed NMI timing back to be the same as several versions ago and just
  special cased Cacoma Knight instead - although kept the code to prevent
  the re-triggering of an NNI more than once in the same frame.
1.30
- Forgot to force GUI surface to be displayed when some dialogs where popped
  up - problem only happened on full-screen mode with triple or double
  buffering enabled, or when using 3dfx mode. It appeared as if Snes9x had
  locked up, but pressing Esc would pop down the hidden dialog.
- Added a couple of options to the Settings dialog. Now its possible to
  disable S-RAM auto-save which was causing Snes9x to write to the hard disk
  every 30 seconds on some games, causing the occasional skipped frame.
- Fixed Reset option which was accidentally broken when Netplay support was
  added.
- Added support for Dirt Racer - it leaves the Super FX chip running all the
  time, so the default CPU emulation method never allocated any time to other
  CPUs and the emulation seemed to lock up.
- NMI timing changed again. Now an NMI can only be triggered once per
  frame and enabling an NMI after the normal trigger scan line triggers
  an NMI immediately. This fixes display glitches in Ys 5, Stargate and
  Daffy Duck.
- Fixed the WAI instruction to only 'wake up' once an actual NMI has
  triggered, rather than just waking up when it should have triggered.
  This fixes Battletoads, broken since version 1.29(ish).
- Changed NMI again. Made reading or writing to PPU register 0x4210 not
  clear NMI pending flag. Seems to allow all the NMI timing sensitive ROMs
  I had on my list to now work without any special hacks. Illusion of
  Gaia now works again.
- Another NMI fix - cleared the CPU pending NMI flag at start of frame;
  Battletoads intro was crashing without this. A long DMA was stopping the
  SNES CPU so it couldn't and shouldn't respond to the NMI signal from the PPU.
- Fixed Netplay problem when game didn't have any S-RAM and Sync Using Reset
  was being used. An error dialog was displayed and the client would disconnect
  from the server.
1.30b#1
- The Windows auto-frame skip code was broken - badly. It didn't re-sync a
  timer value with timer events being generated, causing Snes9x to deliberately
  stop and wait for an event when it didn't need to, slowing down the overall
  emulation speed and increasing the number of frames skipped.
- Improved the Windows cheat search dialog - its now possible to compare
  against a value and more comparison functions are available.
- Finally worked out why Voodoo 3 support was so buggy in Snes9x - the Voodoo 3
  card generates a WM_DISPLAYCHANGE message when switching to Voodoo mode (the
  Voodoo 1 and 2 cards don't); Snes9x thought that some other application had
  changed the screen depth or resolution and tried to adjust its window to
  match - triggering another WM_DISPLAYCHANGE message. No idea how the code
  worked at all; it must have been only by chance and very dependant on the
  driver version you were using!
- Implemented Netplay on the Windows port - but its buggy as hell. I seem to
  be having major Windows multi-threading problems. Comments I've seen seem to
  suggest that Windows 95/98 don't implement true multi-threading; hmm...
- Not happy with the current Netplay, so I scrapped it and tried again;
  the protocol is much improved and not using select to control game timing
  seems to have removed lots of the threading-type problems I was having.
- Attempted to switch to just using Borland's C++ Builder to build the Windows
  port - and failed, again. Although C++ Builder can build Snes9x from sources,
  it can't then link in the asm CPU cores. I had hoped Borland might have
  fixed this with their latest release - they haven't.
- Several attempts to get Anti Resonance's super-fast sound CPU and sound DSP
  code working in Snes9x, but all failed. Part of the problem was his code was
  written using TASM and the object files it generated would only work under
  Windows - but all my SNES debugging code was in the Linux port. Anti' fixed
  that, and I then had some success getting his code working, but its just too
  unstable at the moment for a main-stream release.
- Included an option to use Anti Resonance's alternate sample decoding routine;
  it can approximate the wind and noise sound effects heard in several Square
  Soft games.
- Thanks to Lindsey Dubb for the mode 7 bi-linear filtering code - it
  generates a nice smooth image when a game scales the screen using the SNES'
  mode 7, but you'll a fast machine if you don't want the frame rate to drop.
- Thanks again to Lindsey Dubb, he improved the colour addition/subtraction
  subtraction routines - they are just a little slower but now mostly perform
  full 15-bit precision addition and subtraction rather than the previous
  13-bits of precision. Many more colour shades can be seen - look at the
  improved shading on the Mario Kart or F-Zero track for example.
- Added a reverse stereo option, for people with sound cards that swap the two
  channels.
- Added a sound config dialog to the Windows port - now you can access extra
  sound options that have always been there, but just no GUI interface to
  access them.
- Fixed the 32-bit windowed support on the Windows port.
- Adjusted the NMI timing by a few microseconds to get Metal Warriors working
  again.
- Added a few more sound playback rate choices. Most modern sound cards allow
  any value to be used from a large range, rather than just a select few, may
  be I ought to add text field so you could just type a value in?
- Used Factory Setup 4 to build a new installer package for the Windows port -
  just shipping a zip file was confusing novice users and many (mostly AOL
  users) seemed to have an odd program mapped to .zip files, further confusing
  the issue.
1.29
- Disabled the SPC700 noise feature simulation used by Chrono Trigger and
  Final Fantasy 3 until I work out why its being triggered by sound effects
  that don't use it.
- Rewrote/reorganised the DirectX and 3D/fx handling code, now both are never
  enabled at the same time in Snes9X. It might fix the crashing problems some
  Window port users are seeing. Changing between DirectX and Voodoo 3D/fx
  modes now requires Snes9X to be restarted.
- Tracked down and fixed the Chrono Trigger black screen problem on the Windows
  port: a rogue asm instruction was left in by mistake after some code edits -
  it was only by chance that the code worked on the Linux port.
- Added some SNES debug options to the Windows port, but disabled by default,
  on the shipped version.
- Clicking on the column headings in the OpenROM dialog in the Windows port
  now sorts by that column; plus added some slight screen update optimisations.
- Added an optimisation to graphics rendering: don't add or subtract
  sub-screen from background layers, or clear the sub-screen, if SNES fixed
  colour is black and no background layers are enabled on sub-screen, even if
  ROM tries to enable translucency effects for every background layer.
  Discovered Sonic was doing this, there will be others.
- Forgot to enable auto S-RAM save on Windows port, oops!
1.28
- Warning dialog added to the Windows port - if a ROM is loaded from a
  read-only directory, e.g. a CD, and the freeze file folder is set to be the
  same as the ROM image folder, then a warning is displayed when the game first
  starts.
- The Windows port now supports 5 joy-pads - Snes9x always did support 5 but
  the Windows port lacked the GUI option to enable and configure it.
- Added an about dialog to the Windows port.
- The Windows port now has a simple settings dialog, only one option so far -
  changing the freeze file and S-RAM save directory; much better than having to
  use regedit at least.
- Added a new cheat search dialog, you can use it to find where games are
  storing life counters, health levels, etc. and then add cheats that stop the
  values from changing.
- Added a cheat code entry dialog to the Windows port; now Game Genie,
  Pro-Action Replay and Gold Finger codes can be graphically entered and
  edited.
- Added a master cheat codes on/off toggle, available from the Cheats menu
  on the Windows port.
- Extended the number of cheats per game from 10 to 75.
- Changed cheat code to reapply cheat every emulated frame so if RAM is being
  patched the cheat value is continuously applied.
- Wrote some new cheat search code, the code won't be useful until I get around
  to writing a cheat search dialog.
- Added automatic cheat code loading and saving using the same file format as
  ZSNES.
- Rewrote large parts of the Snes9x cheat handling code ready for adding
  cheat dialogs to the Windows port.
1.27
- Added a flag to only enable SPC700 noise 'feature' when Chrono Trigger or
  Final Fantasy 3 are loaded - the conditions that I thought were necessary to
  trigger the feature where sometimes being met by other games.
- Added a simulation of the SPC700 noise 'feature' where some games, notably
  Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3, play samples that deliberately overrun
  outside a 16-bit value, the SPC700 sound DSP then for some reason starts to
  generate a type of noise sound which the games use to generate wind and
  swish type sound effects. Thanks to ZSNES for some of the information.
- Fixed another sound interpolation problem, thanks to Mikael Bouillot -
  the initial value of the sample byte being played was not being set correctly
  when processing fractional offsets.
- Added auto S-RAM save option; S-RAM is automatically written to a .srm file
  a few seconds (30 by default) after a ROM writes to it - useful for people
  who were playing games long into to night, only to lose their progress
  after a power cut or machine crash.
- NMI delay code changed again - the fix for Cacoma Knight was breaking
  Tuff E Nuff; it would seem delaying NMI until the start of h-blank to too
  long, added a cycle counter instead.
- Fixed yet another clip window bug - clip window was being incorrectly set
  at no range if colour window was enabled but background layer clip window
  was disabled (meaning layer should not be clipped).
  Fixes the sunken ship level on FF5.
- Worked out (by example) how to add keyboard accelerators to the Windows port,
  now toggling full screen using ALT+Return works.
- Added mouse-warp to the Windows port so the the cursor doesn't wonder off the
  Window while SNES mouse emulation is enabled.
- Improved 3dfx support on Windows port - load dialog doesn't drop out of
  bi-linear mode and underlying window zooms to full-screen so its easy to find
  and click on the menu bar with the mouse.
- Added Mouse and Superscope SNES emulation support to the Windows port, use
  '7' on the keyboard to select.
- Windows cursor now hidden unless super scope emulation is enabled.
- Windows port now has command line parsing - cheapo way of adding Game Genie,
  Pro Action Replay cheat codes, disabling sound CPU emulation for the
  corrupt copy of Star Fox 2, etc. Also allows ROM images to be dropped onto
  the Snes9x icon.
- Cacoma Knight seems to provide proof that Snes9x triggers the SNES
  non-maskable interrupt (NMI) too early. Changed interrupt to trigger at the
  start of the next horizontal blank period. Will have to watch for it
  causing problems for other ROMs.
- Added a translucency hack - when a ROM tries to create a stipple background
  pattern by enabling pseudo hi-res. and not enabling a background layer on
  one of the screens, Snes9x changes the effect to use transparency effects
  instead (the real SNES can't do transparency effects with pseudo hi-res.
  enabled). Now the water in Kirby 3 is translucent.
- SA-1 CPU reset bug fixed, now Jumpin' Derby boots and plays but with major
  graphics problems.
- Fixed nasty asm SA-1 custom hardware read/write bug that was causing the
  course map not to be displayed on Augusta Masters and Pebble Beach.
- Added SA-1 character conversion DMA support for all SNES depths, now
  Augusta Masters and Pebble Beach work.
- Merged in minor code changes for Linux running on the Alpha processor. Thanks
  to Sadruddin Rejeb for the changes.
- Added four more auto-multi-player-adaptor-emulation-off presets based on
  code from Mystagogus.
- Added DirectX3D output image processing support to the Windows port... and
  removed it again because it causes my desktop machine to lock up. Back to
  the drawing board...
1.26
- Fixed memory leak that crept in when SA-1 support was added when loading a
  game freeze file.
- Added SPC dumping option based on code from Cyber Warrior X that he sent me
  ages ago but I've just found again while looking for something else!
- Merged in most of the Amiga PPC port source code changes into the main
  source code tree.
- Keying on a sound channel seems to clear its last-sound-sample-block-just-
  played flag. Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune needs this.
- Add multi-thread support to the UNIX ports for sound playing - required in
  the Linux port to work around a Sound Blaster Live driver bug and useful if
  you have multiple CPUs in your machine to help spread the emulation workload.
1.25
- Added BS 24Mbit ROM memory map, for Derby Stallion 96 and Sound Novel-TCool.
  No idea if it works. Thanks to Nose0000 for the info and code.
- Corrected unzip code not to loop forever if an encrypted zip file is loaded -
  an error is generated instead.
- Changed relative SPC700 cycle length for Mortal Kombat 3 to fix sample
  repeat problems - I wish I knew exactly how fast the SPC700 is clocked.
  Maybe I should write a test ROM and run it on a real SNES?
1.24
- 3dfx speed hack back again, only disabled when Seiken 3 is loaded.
- Some minor SA-1 speed ups added - the SA-1 instruction skipping code will
  have to wait until I have more time.
1.23
- Corrected a SA-1 reset bug that reset the SA-1 RAM bank pointer back to block
  zero but didn't clear the RAM bank register. Was causing Kirby 3 to crash.
- Fixed a wave clipping problem with interpolated sound that was causing noise
  on sound output when certain sound samples were played.
- Fixed a bug in the sync-sound code that could overrun the sound buffer by a
  few bytes causing clicks on the sound output.
- The sound sample repeat bug that has plagued Snes9x ever since is was called
  Snes96 finally bit the dust - Snes9x continued to play sample loops
  even if the game dynamically updated the sample not to loop. Fixes the
  stutter in the Mortal Kombat series and improves the sound from several games
  that download sound samples in real-time as they are played.
- Rewrote the code the handled the SPC700's 64 byte shadow RAM area to fix a
  possible sample corruption problem with ROMs that stored samples that
  cross the 64 byte start area.
- Added code to allow ROMs to change the sample being played the next time the
  channel loops or is keyed on - not sure if it fixes anything but seems more
  correct.
- Added a zero-frequency fix to the stereo sound mixing code that I'd already
  added to the mono code some time ago.
- Changed the code to set the end-of-sample flag just before the last block is
  played, rather than just after. Seems to help improve the sound on some
  games.
- Sound sample start code now doesn't reset the channel's envelope volume level
  to zero before starting the sample - helps reduce the clicks being heard when
  a channel envelope volume level hadn't reached zero before being keyed on
  again.
- Changed initialisation of sample-end-register to 0 rather than 255 - seems
  more logical now I've thought about it. Not sure if it helps anything.
1.22
- Finally fixed the corrupt copy of Donkey Kong Country not working problem -
  Snes9x thought the ROM used the same memory map as Street Fighter Alpha 2.
- Added explode, un-shrink and un-reduce decompression modes support to the
  unzip code.
- Fixed offset per tile bug that crept in after me trying to fix the Starfox
  on-tilt bug.
- Made some fixes to the C Super FX emulation code, enough to get most 'FX
  games playable on the Mac port.
1.21
- Finally worked out how character DMA worked on the SA-1 and implemented a
  hacky, slow version, but its enough to get the level up screens displaying
  correctly on Mario RPG.
- Incorporated ZSNES' new optimised Super FX asm code - had to track down and
  fix a nasty memory overwrite bug in the code first to get it to work.
- Changed sample mixing code to not automatically wrap offsets to
  keep inside the sound buffer, external port code is now expected to do that.
  Helped me fix a problem in the Windows port that prevented very large sound
  buffers from working, which are required for some badly written sound card
  drivers.
- Corrected a bug in the SA-1 C code where incorrect processor emulation
  functions where called if the code was compiled with in-lining turned off.
- Fixed crash bug in Super Mario RPG on the level up screen - forgot to mask
  the enable bit from the RAM bank register. Thanks to Christian Wolf for
  sending me a freeze file which made it easy to find the problem.
- Fixed a lockup bug in the window clipping code, if the ROM ever turned off
  the sub-screen completely the clipping code would enter an infinite loop.
  Fixes The Cartoon Addams.
- Made the Daffy Duck NMI fix only enable when Daffy Duck is loaded - fix was
  causing problems for Breath Of Fire 1 and 2.
1.20
- Windows port no longer sets DirectSound to exclusive mode, so its now
  possible to hear sound output from Windows apps while Snes9x has focus.
- Fixed the freeze file loading and saving on the Windows port.
- More GUI settings are saved in the registry on the Windows port now.
- Added 3D/FX image scaling/filtering support to the Windows port.
- Added the TV mode from the Mac/Linux ports to the Windows port.
- Incorporated Kreed's new output image routines into the Windows port that
  fixes RGB555 display colour problems. Many thanks to Kreed.
- New auto-frame rate timing code on the Windows port, stops the silly speed
  up problems when the old code tried to 'catch up' after the emulator had
  been paused.
- Increased the DirectSound secondary buffer length on the Windows port to
  hopefully fix all the static/broken sound output problems some people were
  experiencing.
- Altered the ZSNES Super FX asm code so the Windows port could use it - all
  previous versions of the Windows port were shipped using the C Super FX
  emulation code which is a lot slower.
- Implemented interpolated and sync-sound options on the Windows port.
- Added an image stretch option to the Windows port - stretches the SNES image
  to fill the whole screen or the Window. Looks really good on my TNT card
  since that chips seems to filter the image as it scales it.
- Implemented Windowed mode on the Windows port.
- Added special SPC700 cycle timing for Empire Strikes Back.
- Fixed the missing polygon problem for Super FX games - thanks to zsknight
  for the information.
- Implemented SA-1 support required for Mario RPG, Kirby Superstar,
  Paradius 3, etc. but since only a good image of Mario RPG exists, I could
  only test that game.
- Fixed a graphics clip window bug: inverting the area of a clip area that
  only consisted of empty bands should become the full width of the screen;
  Mario Kart's rear-view mirror display needs it.
- Fixed mode 7 render code to use correct z-buffer when rendering onto the
  sub-screen. Fixes Final Fantasy V title screen.
- Added horizontal offset per tile support in the offset per tile modes 2
  and 6, and switchable horizontal/vertical offset in mode 4. Fixes Chrono
  Trigger in several places and Mario All Stars title screens.
- Changed SPC700 relative cycle length to 14, needed for Stunt Car Racer.
- Enabled immediate triggering of NMI if NMI enable flag set while scan-line
  was on first line of v-blank. Needed to fix a background jitter bug in
  Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions.
- Altered ROM load code to ignore corrupt ROM map type byte in ROM header,
  preventing the code erroneously detecting what it thinks are interleaved
  ROMs. Fixes EEK! The cat, Formation Soccer, the corrupt copy of Donkey
  Kong Country, ...
- Disabled IRQ re-triggering if V-IRQ registers set to the current line. Fixes
  Chuck Rock.
- Fixed missing sprites in Andre Agassi Tennis - writing to low byte only of
  the sprite write address register seems to also clear the hi-byte.
1.19
- Games written by the Japanese software company Human seem to need special
  SPC700 sound CPU timing, so the ROM load and reset routines now check the
  software author company and adjust the CPU cycle length accordingly.
  It gets Clock Tower, Super Fire Pro-wrestling Premium, etc working.
- Added ROM check sum calculation and testing code - Snes9x can now detect
  pure, corrupt or hacked ROMs.
- Noticed a fast way to implement the SNES 4096 colour mode, so I implemented
  it. Now the colours in ActRaiser 2 look correct.
- Corrected a noise frequency error thanks to information from Takehiro.
- Added a 'start in full screen mode' flag to the Linux port.
- While debugging the new graphics code I thought of a fast way to implement
  the SNES direct colour mode, tried it out and now the colours in Actraiser 2
  are correct.
- Blast, forgot about the colour window and fixed colour effects. The separate
  sub-screen is back again, but all the other graphics speed ups are there.
- Now I've got a z-buffer I keep finding other ways to optimise the SNES
  graphics rendering - no need for a separate sub-screen, no need to clear
  the sub-screen to the fixed colour, no need to waste CPU time on translucency
  effects on hidden pixels, no need to completely clear the main-screen to the
  back drop colour, etc., etc.
- Implemented a software z-buffer and changed the SNES graphics rendering to
  use it (required change for future 3D card support). Finally fixes the
  sprite-to-sprite priority bug that some games suffer from. Also a big speed
  increasing for some games (10 fps+), others are slight losers.
- Added code to skip the rendering of completely transparent graphic tiles
  rather than comparing each pixel to see if it is transparent; helps the
  frame rate a bit on some games.
- Added a fixed for Tetris & Dr. Mario - the game didn't like a multi-player 5
  adaptor plugged in to the real SNES when being played, so turned off the
  adaptor emulation for this game.
- Added hack for Final Fantasy II - if sync sound isn't on, make attack rate of
  1ms actually 0ms (old v1.16 behaviour). Causes a slight click but its better
  than samples being cut short.
- Fixed a clip window area invert bug if the colour window was enabled on
  on one window and the other window was being used to clip a background layer.
  Fixes the finial (I hope) display problem with Gun Hazard.
- Added code to intersect the clip window areas if both a colour window and
  a background layer clip window were enabled at the same time. Required by
  Gun Hazard.
- Forgot to mark graphic clip windows as needing recomputing when the master
  colour window inside/outside/on/off/main-screen/sub-screen PPU register was
  updated. Was causing display problems for Gun Hazard.
- Internal H-DMA execution accelerator pointer variables where not always
  being recomputed when started H-DMA part way into a frame. Was causing
  display problems for Gun Hazard.
- Made H-DMA continue for one extra scan-line to fix a disappearing monster
  problem in Dragon Quest 5. Thanks to Alex Jackson for the bug report.
- Zoop seems to require volume envelope height reading by the sound CPU to
  always return 0 when the channel is in gain mode.
- The sound code was ignoring updates to the ADSR volume envelope rates while
  one was in progress. Fixed that and now the bird song at the start of
  Chrono Trigger sounds correct.
- Had to disable the CPU shutdown code for loops reading the horizontal beam
  position, it was causing problems for Star Fox. Still no polygons though.
- Oops, sound DSP noise output was broken - accidentally deleted an important
  line while removing debug code ready for the last release.
- Added initial 3Dfx support to the Linux port - basically using the Voodoo
  card as a bi-linear filtering, scaling blitter. Actually slightly slower than
  TV mode, for non-scrolling images due to poor texture upload speeds to the
  card, but the full-screen feature is nice and the speed doesn't drop as more
  of the screen changes.
1.18
- Implemented a sync-sound mode where sound data gets generated in sync with
  SPC700 instructions being executed. Finally the sound Williams Arcade
  classics can be heard. Also helps slight sound timing problems in many other
  games but doesn't fix Mortal Kombat 2 like I thought it would - its
  sound routine programmers must have been on drugs or something!
- Added interpolated sound - gives low frequency sounds much more bass similar
  to a real SNES especially with the playback rate ramped up to 44KHz.
- Added on-screen messages as various emulation options are toggled on and off
  using the in-game keys.
- Fixed a PPU register read bug with the sprite register write position. Thanks
  to Takehiro TOMINAGA for the bug report.
- Altered the auto-frame skip timing code to only wait and re-sync to the end
  of frame when frames haven't been skipped. Again thanks to Takehiro.
- Speeded up the colour addition and subtraction code using ideas from
  Takehiro.
1.17
- Linux and UNIX sound code now driven directly from signal timer handler
  rather than the timer handler just setting a flag which had to be polled in
  the main emulation code. Slightly faster execution.
- Fixed the crash bug in the ZSNES Super FX asm code with Vortex - the game's
  polygons still aren't visible though.
- Implemented bent-line increase and exponential decay and sustain volume
  envelopes - they should match, or at least be very similar to the real SNES
  sound DSP chip now.
- It would seem ROMs can key on sound channels even if the channel hasn't
  been keyed-off, Pac-In-Time requires it. Changed code to allow it.
- Quick mod to ZSNES Super FX code to get Winter Gold working - it was already
  working with the C Super FX code.
- Added emulation of the extra 1/2 scan-line per frame on PAL and NTSC -
  should help improve music speed emulation.
- Worked around the click sound heard when ROMs use 0 volume envelope attack
  rate.
- Removed the 'check for IRQ already happened' H-IRQ position register setting
  code - it was causing problems for Ninja Warriors and was not required by
  F1 Grand Prix.
- Fixed a bug in the new sound code - the sustain part of the
  attack-decay-sustain-release volume envelope was being skipped if the
  sustain level wasn't at 100%. The fix has helped some music notes from
  being cut off early in a few games.
- Added fix to Pro Action Reply support (again). Thanks to Paul Shoener III for
  the original fix and Gil Pedersen for reminding me to apply it!
- Finally fixed the Tales of Phantasia 'bum note' problem! The ROM set its
  sample directory to the upper-most page and I forget to code for the hidden
  64 bytes of RAM, that appear when the boot ROM is switched off, when fetching
  sample addresses.
- Adjusted the relative cycle length between the 65c816 and the SPC700 slightly
  to get Terranigma working again.
- Oops, the emulated joypads 3 and 4 via the emulated Multi-player 5 interface
  weren't working. Thanks to Steffen Schwenke for the bug report.
- Optimised the echo sound code - by-passed the the FIR filter code if only
  a pass-through FIR filter was defined by the ROM.
- Modified V and H-IRQ register changing code to trigger an IRQ immediately if
  V-IRQ is enabled and the scan-lines match and either H-IRQ is not enabled or
  the electron beam position has already gone past the trigger point. Fixes
  the screen flicker in F1 Grand Prix.
- Modified the priority-per-pixel mode 7 code to use BG#1's clipping data if
  the top bit of the mode 7 pixel is set. Fixes initial track drive-through
  display in F1 Grand Prix.
- Modified the sprite priority levels for the priority-per-pixel mode 7
  display. Now the car can be seen in F1 Grand Prix.
- Wrote a sound DSP register recording scheme which 'plays back' the register
  changes in sync with the sound generation code. I'm bit disappointed, it
  only improves the sound in a very few games... Scrapped the code, it actually
  causes more problems than it fixes. Oh, well, another 3 weeks work wasted...
- Fixed a SPC700 wake up problem for Lufia I - made the SPC700 also wake up
  when the 65c816 read from one of the four comm ports.
- Included lots of sound code speed ups and sound quality improvements
  from Takehiro TOMINAGA - many thanks go to him.
1.16
- Fixed a case where the -forcelorom option didn't work - the case was
  required for Formation Soccer which claims in its ROM header to use the
  same memory map as Super FX ROM, it doesn't.
- Pulled apart a real SNES using a crowbar (great fun), just to look at what
  speed the SPC700 is actually clocked at for more accurate relative emulation
  speed.
- Implemented SPC700 cycle counting in the hope the improved timing would fix
  Tales'; no such luck but at least the -ratio option is obsolete now.
- Implemented executing SPC700 instructions during DMA, fixes BSZelda and
  Goal lock up at start and music pausing briefly when ROMs do lots of DMA,
  usually between game screens.
- Scrapped the i386 asm SPC700 code - it was the cause of the music not
  restarting after a battle in Chrono Trigger and FF3 and I didn't realise
  because the bug had already occurred in the test freeze-file I had.
  Thanks to John Stiles for pointing out that the Mac port didn't have the
  missing music problem.
- Fixed RGB subtraction bug on displays with only 5 bits for green, e.g. RGB555
  displays. The GREEN_HI_BIT variable was always set to a value for 6 bit
  green displays.
- Added the SA-1 memory map, still a long way to go before any SA-1 game will
  run.
1.15
- Jumped versions to keep in sync with the DOS port release.
1.14
- Improved 8-bit sound generation slightly, but it still sounds very poor
  compared to 16-bit sound.
1.13
- Implemented the Tales of Phantasia memory map using the information supplied
  by zsKnight. Had to also implement a de-interleave routine to work around
  a ROM feature and Snes9x CPU instruction fetching implementation detail.
- Added a frames-per-second on-screen display option.
- Fixed the final glitch bug with the Mario Kart track display - the byte code
  for the termination of the DSP1 raster command wasn't been recognised.
- Disabled a NMI/DMA hack for Rise of the Robots, was causing problems for
  Mario Kart and 'Robots wasn't working correctly anyway.
- Optimised the mode 7 rendering a little.
- Changed tile rendering code to use offsets into screen buffer rather than
  direct pointers ready for z-buffer implementation.
1.12
- Changed V-blank NMI to occur immediately after a WAI instruction, Toy Story
  required this.
- Fixed reading of H-DMA line counter register, Top Gear 3000 needed this.
- Ripped off large parts of ZSNES's DSP1 code (with _Demo_'s and zsKnight's
  approval). Now Mario Kart works almost 100%.
- Added a check to see if a vertical scan-line IRQ register change will cause
  a H-IRQ later on the current scan-line. Pilot Wings needed this.
- Fixed possible crash bug in clip window code when both windows had two
  spans. Could actually cause Chrono Trigger to crash the emulator.
- Fixed a lock-up problem with the C Super FX code, Star Fox and executing
  a few 'FX instructions per scan-line (required for Winter Gold).
1.11
- Partially fixed the DOS netplay server - the server timer is running too
  slowly and it doesn't deal with disconnects correctly yet.
- Corrected the sound echo delay - it was varying with the sound playback
  rate chosen by the user - it shouldn't have been.
- Implemented DOS netplay code - DOS server code still not working though.
- Removed all floating point calculations from the sound generation code.
- Fiddled with the pitch modulation code - my guess is the output of a
  channel that is used to modulate the frequency of another channel is
  automatically muted by the SPC700 chip. Just a guess, but the wind from
  FF3 sounds 'better' but far from perfect.
- Optimised the tile palette index calculation.
- Optimised the planar to chunky tile conversion code.
- Fixed X11 port to always scale SNES image if hi-res. only (no interpolation)
  support is enabled.
- Added zipped ROM image support using Gilles Vollant unzip code and
  some code that Ivar (Lestat) sent me a long time ago.
- 65c816 asm RTI instruction was destroying the program bank in emulation mode,
  the C code was already correct. Caused C64E to break.
1.10
- Finished NetPlay v1 - allows up to five networked machines to play
  multi-player SNES games, one player on each machine.
- Switchable full-screen mode added to Linux X11 port, some code and ideas
  nicked from Maciej Babinski's original Snes9x XFree86 DGA Linux port, the
  UAE Amiga emulator, plus lots of my own code.
1.08
- Bug fixes to C Super FX emulation - now Winter Gold works correctly again.
1.07
- More DSP1 work. Mario Kart is now playable! The character projection code
  is still broken so the opponents and obstacles aren't always positioned
  correctly on screen and you keep bumping into them, but I can still keep
  coming first!
- Started work on NetPlay support.
- Decreased sound card DMA buffer size on DOS port to improve sound generation
  and sound CPU synchronisation in some games.
- Included Linux joystick driver patches from Vojtech Pavlik so the port can
  use the new v1.x joystick drivers, again written by Vojtech Pavlik. Allows
  use of Micro$oft Sidewinder pads, NES and SNES pads, PlayStation pads,
  Gamepad Pros, etc.
- Added halve-the-result colour subtraction.
1.06
- Extended code to allow support for multiple 16-bit screen formats,
  switchable at run-time, rather just supporting one, selectable at compile
  time.
- Added XFree86 DGA Linux port - code from Maciej Babinski.
- More fixes to the X11 image format conversion and setup code.
- The asm SetByte routine wasn't wrapping writes to S-RAM correctly, allowing
  some ROMs to think they were running on a copier and put up an error
  screen. Thanks to Nu of #rom for the report.
- Added 'TV-Mode' support (interpolation and scan-lines) to the DOS and
  UNIX ports from code based on John Stiles work.
- Added v-sync option to the DOS port.
- Added fix to Pro Action Reply support, thanks to Paul Shoener III.
- Added ggi support (untested) to Linux port using patches from
  Alexander Larsson (alla@lysator.liu.se).
- Added 16 to 24/32 bit image conversion routines to the UNIX X11 code.
- The SPC700 OR1 instruction was broken. Thanks to Pyrgopolinices for the
  report.
- DOS port was having trouble splitting and joining path names - caused
  problems when specifying the full path name of a ROM when the ROM image
  was on another drive.
- If a ROM reset the sound DSP and then turned on echo effects but kept
  the same echo delay setting, then the echo effects could not be heard.
  Thanks to madec@mclink.it for the bug report and freeze file that made it
  easy to find the problem.
- DOS port was always using stereo sound setting, if sound card
  supported it, regardless of the user preference.
- Linux port X11 port could crash if window was resized while transparency
  effects were enabled.
- The colour subtraction accelerator look-up table was slightly wrong, causing
  one bit of red, green blue values to 'spill' into the next field.
- Allowed colour window to cut a hole in the main-screen and show the sub-
  screen underneath. The effect is used by Illusion of Gaia.
- Added support for colour subtraction, with the halve-the-result flag
  set.
- Included DSP1 code from _Demo_. Now you can see the track in Mario Kart and
  the ground in Pilot Wings - still can't play the games though due to other
  missing commands.
- Added an NMI hack to work around a code bug in Battle Toads: BATTLEMANIACS,
  its only by chance that the game works on a real SNES - And disabled it
  again because it causes problems for Chrono Trigger.
- A frame skip of zero was actually still skipping one frame. Thanks to
  Marius Fodor for the info.
- And yet more X-OR window bug fixes - now the effects during some of the more
  'posh' spells look correct in Chrono Trigger.
- Yet another window area inversion bug - off by one pixel on right-hand edge.
- Forgot to put dummy start and end points for XOR window combination modes -
  now Uniracers looks correct and Sailor Moon looks like it does on a real
  SNES.
- Window clip code was using wrong index into a 2-dimensional array when
  the whole of the main or sub-screens were clipped.
1.05
- The master volume disable code was looking that the wrong variable!
- Fixed crash bug in newer sound code if a ROM tried to start a sample
  playing who's data went past the end of SPC700 memory. (Cannon Fodder)
1.04
- Fixed DSP1 ROM header detection bug.
- More DSP1 work; still nothing works, although I know the multiply command
  is correct because I've compared the results against a real DSP1.
1.03
- Oops, the multi-player 5 disable code change broke the multi-player 5 being
  the default controller.
- Implemented the colour window on the main screen - now Zelda's oval zoom
  window displays correctly and Krusty's Super Fun House clips the left-most
  8 pixels as it does on the real SNES.
- TERRANIGMA didn't like me returning a random value when it attempted to
  read a channel's the current sample byte.
- Hacked in initial support for mode 7 priority-per-pixel - the priority bit
  doesn't actually change the priority of the pixel but the two games that I
  know of that use the feature look OK. (Winter Extreme Skiing and the
  intro of Tiny Toons Adventures).
- Colour addition/subtraction code now uses RGB565 rather than RGB555
  calculations - helps a little with the loss of the bottom bit of SNES
  colour data.
- DSP1 emulation started - nothing works yet.
1.02
- Switched to adding back drop colour rather than fixed colour when
  sub-screen addition is enabled but there's nothing on the sub-screen.
  Uniracers seems to need it. - DISABLED it again. Causes problems for
  other ROMs and Uniracers itself on later screens.
- Fixed XOR window logic combination mode and area inversion code, now
  Uniracers works correctly.
- Oops, if colour window and half colour addition/subtraction were both
  switched on, area outside colour window was still being halved, it shouldn't.
  Hacky fix at the moment until I implement the correct fix.
- Fixed several bugs with the mosaic effect and 16x16 tiles and a few
  possible background scroll offset bugs and the mosaic effect.
- Optimised the sound sample generation code for cases when the SNES
  sample playback frequency was higher than the sound card playback rate.
- Fixed possible click sound when a sample was first started to be played.
1.01
- Corrected scan-line count for PAL games - should be 312 lines verses 262 for
  NTSC. Was causing slow music on PAL games.
- Added error correction code to the SPC700 timer update code - the
  SPC700 timers are updated using the emulated h-blank handler which is
  called every emulated 63.6 microseconds (15.720KHz) but the SPC700 timers
  need to be updated at multiples of 8KHz, hence the error. Was causing
  music to be played slightly too fast.
- Switched back to using C SPC700 code - the old SPC700 asm code was lacking
  several optimisations that the C version had. It also had multiple
  speed hack cycle skipping bugs. Plus I hadn't even finished optimising
  all the code from the last time I converted the C compiler output.
- Optimised SPC700 memory access routines a little.
- Disabled code that prevented ROMs updating SPC700 timer values while the
  timer was running - it seems like it is allowed, even though docs on the
  'net I've seen say its not.
1.0
- Fixed SuperScope support.
- Added hi-res. option to my DOS port.
- Fixed 4, 6, and 8 button standard PC joystick support.
- Changed some types the source code was using BYTE -> uint8, WORD -> uint16,
  DWORD -> uint32 and BOOL -> bool8, types were clashing Windows typedefs
  but sizes didn't always match.
0.99
- 8-bit double height and/or width tile rendering was missing every other
  group of 4 pixels - screen pointer advance count was wrong.
- Asm SPC700 emulation was ignoring the Shutdown flag - the result is its
  not possible to turn off cycle skipping for the SPC700 emulation.
0.98
- CPU to ROM address decoding code rewritten - used by Game Genie cheat codes,
  orginal code might have been the cause of some Game Genie codes not working.
- Started to remove printf calls and replace them with calls to S9xMessage,
  port code can then dicide what to do with message.
0.97
- Re-enabled decompressed sample caching, still has a possible click problem
  but the sound code is a lot faster with it enabled. Added command line option
  to disable it if required.
- Added '7' key support to rotate through available controller options, in
  the order multi-player5, mouse on #1, mouse on #2, superscope,
  standard controller and then back to multi-player5.
- Hi-res. (512x448) support fixed.
- Mouse support completed - Lemmings 2 and Mario Paint working a treat.
- More colour window fixes.
- Fixed freeze game problem when ZSNES SuperFX code is being used -
  ZSNES 'FX state was not being saved and restored.
- ZSNES SuperFX asm emulation code plugged in to Snes9x.
0.96
- Looks like if the colour window is not enabled at all and the colour
  window selector is defined to only allow colour effects inside the colour
  window, then no effects should be visible.
- Offset-per-tile rendering code didn't support width 64 screen size, which
  Chrono Trigger used on its title screen.
- Contra 3 seems to prove that defining the clip window area to be 'outside'
  a window that covers the whole screen is not an area with no range.
  - No it doesn't. It proves that I shouldn't have initialised the right
    window edges to 255! Contra 3 enables clipping windows without first
    defining their range.
- Debug frame advance feature was being prevented from forcing the next
  frame to be rendered by SyncSpeed which was being called after the
  debugger returned to the main loop.
- H-DMA code was allowing ROMs to manually start H-DMA during the v-blank
  period, ROMs shouldn't be allowed to do this.
- Asm code would not push the correct CPU status onto the emulated stack if
  returning from an NMI immediately triggered an IRQ - fixes Mortal Kombat 1
  and War of the Gems.
- 'd' dump memory debug command was not preserving the CYCLES count.
- C versions of SNES memory access code had same problem as asm code on the DOS
  port except it didn't cause a crash just ROMs failed to work correctly.
- Asm i386 code was using signed compares to check for special case memory
  areas - it was causing crash problems on the DOS port which was sometimes
  returning valid address values with the top bit set - i.e. they seemed
  like negative values!
- Changed event reschedule code to always allow h-blank start events, used to
  disable them during v-blank period.
- Added code to HDMA when end of visible lines reached.
- Changed register 4212 code not to always return h-blank when in v-blank.
- Clipping fixed colour addition to background area was off by one pixel on
  the right-hand edge.
- HDMA: Finally worked out how the real SNES operates when ROMs manual
  start H-DMA during the frame - ROMs must set up the H-DMA line count
  and address values before H-DMA is started.
- Fixed the asm code to remove all hard-wired structure offsets - one offset
  into the IPPU structure was wrong in the code because the structure had
  changed size.
- Added colour window support and allowed graphic window settings to be
  different on the main screen and sub screen, just like a real SNES.
- SuperFX LJMP instruction had bank and address values swapped.
- Fixed possible memory overwrite problem because OBJList array was one
  element too short.
- Added AND multi-graphic window combo support.
- ROM image memory allocation allocates an extra 32K of RAM, then moves the
  pointer forward by that amount - stops the SuperFX emulation from accessing
  unallocated memory, possibly causing a crash.
- SuperFX emulation now stores sign and zero flags in separate variables so
  the MERGE instruction can set flags correctly.
- Added 65c816 instruction skipping to i386 asm code when 65c816 waiting in
  a simple loop for some 'event' to happen e.g. end of frame NMI.
- Finally fixed the APU instruction skipping problem with the i386 asm
  code when the WAI instruction is used - caused slow music on some ROMs.
- Offset-per-tile modes don't seem to support screen size - Mario All Stars
  Super Mario 2 requires this on title screen. Doesn't seem to effect
  Tetris Attack or Puzzle Bobble.
- Changed SNES select and start keys from shift and control to space and
  enter - allows shift-fn key to save game positions without the SNES ROM
  also getting a select joypad button press.
- Multiplayer5 support for controllers 3+ was broken for ROMs that used
  automatic hardware joypad reading rather than reading joypads serially.
- ResetPPU was not clearing tile caches and marking OBJ as need recomputing.
- Cached OBJ positions and sizes were not being recomputed if ROM changed
  global OBJ sizes during frame.
- Fixed brightness multiplication problem on 16-bit code for green.
- SPC700 emulation now uses one variable to store ZERO and NEGATIVE flags.
- SPC700 emulation now only increments PC once at end of instruction.
- New ROM type and interleaved detection code.
- Reading sound DSP register ENDX also clears the value. The docs on the
  'net said that only writing to the register cleared its value. Fixes
  sound in Zoop.
- Fixed mode 4 colour palette problem on background #2 in tile-based graphics
  code.
- Fixed graphics mode 4, offset-per-tile support. Only one set of offset data
  that is switchable between horizontal and vertical, unlike modes 2 and 6
  which allow separate horizontal and vertical offsets per tile.
- Modified the APU timer code again, if the timer is enabled, a write to the
  timer target register is only allowed if a value hasn't been written yet.
  Fixed Donkey Kong Country 1 and Earth Worm Jim 1 & 2.
- Attack rate of 0ms changed from 1ms back to 0ms because of a group of ROMs
  that change from attack mode to decay mode in real-time. Will change back
  when I've added better SPC700 CPU and sound generation sync code.
- Added support for ROMs set a new sound timer value while the timer is
  enabled (EWJ 1 & 2).
- Added support for ROMs that read the sound envelope height (MK1, MK2, etc).
- ROMs writing to the H-DMA enable register during visible scan-lines were
  restarting H-DMA for that frame causing random screen effect corruption.
- Echo feedback seems to be after the FIR filter, not before as a diagram I've
  seen suggests.
- Sound pitch modulation added.
- Memory access routines changed to pass a single 24-bit address rather than
  the previous separate 8-bit bank and 16-bit address parameters.
0.3
- Updates to A-Bus address during a frame must not update H-DMA address.
  Fixes Actraiser 2 and Pacman 2.
- Removed sound volume mangling - with echo support enabled it doesn't seem to
  be required.
- Attack rate of 0ms changed to 1ms to help prevent click sound with sudden
  start of a sample playing.
- Sample caching of samples that looped using part of the original sample
  created a click on the sound output. Caching disabled for the moment. Would
  require 512K of cache RAM to fix sample caching.
- Colour addition/subtraction support added - but still a little buggy in
  places and very slow.
- 16-bit colour support added.
- Sustain sound volume was not being set if a sample using ADSR was started
  with both the attack rate and decay rate set to zero - resulted in missing
  sound samples on with some games.
- Sound echo support added.
- Sound channel mixing code was not completely clearing a channel's sound
  buffer when a channel finished playing a sample.
- Sound mixing code rewritten to use one buffer, rather than writing each
  channel into a separate buffer then combining them into one buffer.
- Memory access routines rewritten to use an 8K block lookup table rather than
  dedicated code for each ROM memory map - it was getting difficult to support
  the new types of SNES ROM memory maps becoming apparent.
- Sound sample decoding wasn't decoding sound samples correctly if a
  previously cached sample was only partially overwritten by the ROM as
  opposed to being completely replaced.
- Sound sample decoding wasn't clipping generated sample values correctly.
- Changed H-DMA to start in the current frame only if enable register is
  written to during v-blank, h-blank or while the screen is blanked.
- The SPC700 seems to start executing instructions before the 65c816 -
  shorter reset pulse? (NO - forgot the SPC700 executes instructions while DMA
  is taking place).
- ROMs that reset the H-IRQ position so another IRQ would be triggered on the
  same scan-line where not supported - Super Off-Road: The Baj needs it.
- $4212 bit 7 needs to go high at the end of h-blank at line 224 not at the
  start of h-blank - Bubsy needs it.
- Sample decoding routine could write to memory outside sample cache area if
  address of block to decode was greater than $0x10000 - 9.
- Walking mario can be seen on map screen of MarioWorld - needed sprite
  priority rotation working. ROM sets bit 7 of $2103 then sets rotation in
  $2102. Reset rotation at start of v-blank not at end.
0.24
- Fixed reading of DMA register values - now Ms Pacman works.
- Saved sprite memory address being restored on the wrong scan-line - caused
  corrupt sprites on at least one game (GANBARE GOEMON 2).
- Screen colour palette not being updated if ROM only wrote to low byte of
  palette register.
- Possible memory corruption fixed if a ROM tried to write to an invalid
  sprite address via PPU registers.
- X11 port support quick load and save by pressing function keys to load or
  shift + function keys to save.
0.23
- Added option to disable graphic window effects - T2: The Arcade Game doesn't
  seem to like them.
- Mode 7 "outside screen area" register interpretation fixed - now the
  Actraiser map screen looks a lot better.
- Old DMA code hack for Battle Toads: Double Dragon removed as it was no
  longer required and it was causing problems for Ys III.
- Lowered max volume level of 16-bit sound mixing code to help with sound
  clipping problems is lots of SNES sound channels are playing.
0.22
- Crash bug fixed in mode 7 graphics windows code
0.21
- Fixed a noise channel volume bug - noise waveform was getting clipped.
- Fixed 24bit X Window System server support on the Solaris port.
- Sprites in priority level 1 on mode 7 were being drawn incorrectly behind
  graphics screen.
- BG 3 priority 1 tiles sometimes not drawn dependent on the $2105 bit 3
  setting.
- Added graphic window support the tile redraw code.
- Added mosaic support to tile redraw code.
- Tile redraw code was drawing one line too many on screen-splits.
- Tile-based redraw code made more intelligent about when a background should
  be displayed or not.
- Added wrap within bank support to large DMAs just to support Rock 'n' Roll
  racing.
0.20
- DMA routines added lots of special cases and removed most calls to GetByte,
  using a pointer instead.
- Multiple using PPU registers is now only computed when first byte of result
  is actually read.
- Sound enabled by default if compiled without DEBUGGER defined.
- Tile redraw method made the default.
- Fixed CPU_SHUTDOWN so SPC700 continues to execute even if main CPU is
  "skipping" cycles waiting for an event to happen.
- More command line options added.
- Default cycles-per-scan-line to execute lowered to 90% from 100%.
- +/- keys now work even if auto-frame rate adjust was enabled.
- SPC700 emulation partially rewritten in assembler.
- Asm 65c816 code change to use same speed up techniques as the C++ code.
- Minor speed tweaks to the sound decoding and mixing code.
- C++ SPC700 emulation changed to use same method as 65c816 emulation for
  computing and storing emulated CPU flags.
- Mode 7 code rewritten and several scrolling offset bugs fixed.
- Lo-ROM S-RAM memory map bug fixed - now Uniracers works.
- Multiple speed ups and changes to the tile and line-based redraw code.
- Tile and line redraw code changed to cache converted tiles between frames.
- Variable cycle length timing made compile-tile switchable.
- C++ 65c816 emulation changed to use several opcode jump tables to avoid
  a register size comparison test on most emulated instructions.
- C++ 65c816 emulation changed how is computes and stores emulated CPU flags.
- Fixed high frequency sound playback bug - the sample rate calculation was
  blowing the range of an unsigned long.
- Fixed V-RAM reading so DKC3, Addams Family, Aladdin and Pacman all work.
- Fixed sound code so ROMs can change from ADSR mode to decrease mode - fixes
  lots of ROMs.
0.12 released
- Added dynamic speed regulation.
- TCALL vector calculation change from n to 15 - n.
- Fixed crash bug if ROM writes to sound DSP register numbers greater than
  127.
- Fixed DOS memory locked for interrupt code.
- Added long name versions of command line switches.
- Added command line switch for SPC700_SHUTDOWN code and WAI cycle skipping
  code.
0.1 released
- All DOS memory is now locked from being swapped.
- Fixed DOS port keyboard polling code - could get confused if a keyboard
  interrupt happened while keys were being checked.
- SPC700 ADC instruction never cleared Overflow or Carry flags!
- Changed selection of playback speeds for Solaris port.
- Sample caching code was broken - cached samples were never used.
- Added code speed ups for ROMs that use a lot of DMA to VRAM.
- More cpu code asm speed up.
- Fixed 16x16 size tiles on tile-based redraw code.
- Fixed sound gain-mode increase and decrease volume envelopes.
- Added code to support ROMs that reuse sprites in the same frame.
- Fixed processing of negative volume levels.
- Fixed SPC700 EOR1 instruction.
- Added SPC700 shutdown code to stop executing SPC700 instructions if in
  a tight loop waiting for a timer or for the 65C816 to respond.
- DOS playback rate was being forced to 16KHz by Allegro - fixed.
- Fixed bug in SPC700 MOV1 C,bit, address.
- Fixed a off-by-one loop sample pointer bug in MixSamples.
- Added command line flags for cached-tile based drawing and sub-screen
  background layers priority swapping.
- NOPE, got encoding of the OR1/EOR1,AND1 range of correct originally -
  got duff information from an "SPC700" programmer.
- More SPC700 fixes: got the encoding of the OR1/EOR1,AND1 range of
  instructions wrong - I guessed wrong originally.
- Sample looping bug fix on mono sound mixing code.
- Sound pitch value no-longer clipped to 14 bits - apparently FF3 needs this.
- Followed Paradox's suggestion and changed graphics code to place sub-screen
  background layers below main-screen background layers. Helps lots of games
  that use sub-screen addition/subtraction - now you don't have to toggle
  background layers on and off so often just to see hidden text, characters,
  or maps, etc. Made it switchable.
  Acts as a good intermediate solution until sub-screen addition/subtraction
  is actually implemented.
- Modified sound skipper code to return random values when ROM is stuck
  waiting for the SPC700 CPU to respond - helps several ROMs that previously
  don't work with the currently selection of APU skippers.
- Improved sound mixing code so volume is not attenuated so much, giving
  better results on 8bit sound cards.
- Changed the frequency at which the joystick polling routine is called - now
  called every-other frame rather than every 3rd frame.
- Recompiled Linux and DOS ports with the Pentium optimising version of gcc -
  gives a few percent speed increase.
- Changed V-RAM increment count from 64 to 128 - apparently Final Fantasy 3
  needs this as well.
- Fixed sprite priority bug with Mode 7 - apparently Final Fantasy 3 needs
  this.
- Fixed a screen clipping problem with the S-VGA mode.
- Fixed bug that had crept in with -m 2 S-VGA mode (Linux version).
- Fixed S-VGA Linux version with sound enabled.
- The SPC700 ADC (X),(Y) instruction was broken - with all these SPC700 fixes
  now many more ROMs work with sound enabled.
- The SPC700 Pop PSW instruction was not resetting the direct page location.
- The SPC700 instruction MOV A,[DP+X] was incorrectly doing a MOV A,DP+X.
- Got the SPC700 SETx and CLRx instruction encoding swapped around.
- Fixed #define problem that was stopping DOS snapshot saving from working.
0.72 released
- Fixed the DOS filename handling - old Unix code was screwing up with ROM
  filenames that contained backslashes (\) - the ROM would load but S-RAM
  loading and saving would fail and the default filename for snapshots
  wouldn't work.
- This time really fixed Allegro library keyboard handling (DOS port); it
  was missing key some presses/releases (was stopping Chrono Trigger
  Left + Right + A button combo from working).
- Added code to automatically remove headers off S-RAM save files with
  512 byte headers.
- 32Mbit ROMs in interleaved format are now automatically detected and
  converted.
- Added -ss 3 sound skip method support to the asm version - now NBA Live '96
  works again.
- Added support for multi-part ROM images.
0.71 released
- Made libgz.so statically linked (again) on Linux port - sorry.
- Made writing to $4200 also clear any pending IRQs. This finally allows
  Battle Toads: Double Dragon, Spawn and Sieken 3 all the work with the same
  IRQ logic (but Sieken 3 still gets stuck in sound download code).
- Fixed a H-DMA wobble bug - some frames could randomly miss a line of
  H-DMA causing the F-Zero screen to wobble, and slight text character
  corruption on games like DKC3.
- Interleaved format ROM images are now swapped in-place, without the need
  for a temp 4Mb buffer (saves lots of disk swapping on a 16Mb Windows 95
  machine).
0.7 released
- Fixed Allegro library keyboard handling (DOS port); it was missing key
  some presses/releases.
- DOS port had a different MAX_PATH value which moved the location of the
  SRAM size variable when using the asm CPU emulation core. This, in turn,
  caused the SRAM emulation to fail on the DOS port. Donkey Kong County 2 & 3
  were reporting a ROM copier was connected to the SNES and refused to run.
- Fixed assembler version of XCE - it was always leaving the carry flag
  clear - caused Killer Instinct and Super Punchout to think a ROM
  copier was fitted to the SNES and they all refused to run.
- Fixed assembler versions of MVN/MVP - they weren't setting the data bank
  register to the destination bank of the instruction.
- Fixed joystick detection on MS-DOS port - a single 2 or 4 button joystick in
  port 1 was being ignored if a second joystick was not present in port 2.
- Fixed an uninitialised variable in graphics code - was causing random
  missing scan lines on Mode 7 screens.
- Joysticks now scanned every 3rd frame (joystick scanning is slow in the PC).
- Double-whoops, Metriod 3 had stopped working in v0.6 - fixed it
  (memory map bug).
- Made bit 6 of $4211 set if v-counter == v-timer-position.
- Made reading of $4200 read $4212 instead.
- Adjusted DMA timing to always access ROM memory at slow speed - this seems
  to fix Battle Toads.
- Added code to automatically clear pending IRQs when the horizontal line
  is no longer equal to the horizontal timer line - this fixes Seiken 3, it
  now just gets stuck in the sound CPU wait code - oh well.
- Moved NMI back to its original pre-0.65 behaviour, now Puzzle Bobble works.
- More graphics speed ups - the code to render background tiles with their
  priority bits set is only called if there are actual priority-bit tiles.
- Changed default frame skip rate from 1 to 2 - its seems most people don't
  bother to read the docs, so I thought I'll help them out a bit!
- Speeded up Mode 7 graphics on games like F-Zero that rewrite the matrix
  registers on each scan line using H-DMA.
- Reorganised the graphics code and did a slight speed up - graphics code
  will be the next thing to rewrite in assembler.
- Rewrote CPU core in assembler for Intel platforms - gives a very noticeable
  speed increase.
- Fixed several problems with the APU sound CPU emulation - its now getting
  stable enough to try and implement sound.
- Fixed bug that caused 1 byte of S-RAM to be emulated when ROM didn't
  expect any - it was enough to stop Street Fighter 2 and others from
  working - thanks Lord ESNES.
- The TXS and TCS instructions shouldn't set the Z and N flags.
- Looks like MVP/MVN instructions should ignore accumulator size - change
  code to always use all 16 bits and exit with accumulator set to 0xffff.
- Whoops, accidently left some test code in which was causing the V-BLANK
  flag, bit 8 in register $4212, to be miss-calculated.
- Fixed palette in mode 0.
- Speeded up graphics drawing a little by skipping groups of 4 pixels that
  were all transparent.
0.65 released
- S-VGA and MS-DOS ports now have a VGA mode command line flag.
- Improved the fading code - should be much more smooth now.
- Fixed second joy-pad support and re-mapped keys and joysticks to actually
  make a match between what my docs said and a real SNES (SNES docs I'd
  seen were wrong!).
- Fixed a bug in Relative Long CPU addressing mode.
- Ported Snes96 to MS-DOS.
- Snapshot loading and saving no longer uses external gzip binary.
- Added support for registers at $21c2 and $21c3.
- Made reading the software latch for the horizontal and vertical counters also
  clear any pending IRQ.
- Added sprite priority rotation.
- Rewrote parts of the graphics routines to fix a sprite-to-sprite priority
  bug.
- NMI flag changed again - now back to being reset by reading $4210 but
  actual NMI is delayed.
- Made mode 7 background colour 0 transparent - this fixed several sprite
  priority problems a few games where having.
- Finally worked out how sprite "Object Name Select" works and emulated it -
  this fixes many (if not all) of the corrupted sprites some games
  experienced.
- Delayed NMI activation for one instruction to give time for loops that
  wait for bit 7 of $4210 to go high.
- Special-cased line count of 128 on H-DMA to mean repeat previous data with
  a line count of 128 and not just terminate H-DMA on that channel.
- APU sound CPU emulation added - just need to debug the thing.
- Fixed Overflow flag setting in ADC and SBC instructions - it was never
  being set.
- Rewrote how CPU instructions are fetched and how values are pushed and pulled
  from the stack - it gave a very large increase in emulation speed.
- H-DMA was being started one scan-line too late.
- Added CG-RAM reading support.
- Added "Full Graphic" V-RAM reading.
- Speeded up C version of CPU emulation quite a bit - could speed it up a
  little more before rewriting in assembler.
- Fixed bugs in 16x16 tile drawing on 2bit and 8bit deep screens.
0.6 released
- Speeded up 16x16 tile background rendering by removing a temp tile buffer
  it was using. The speed up also fixed a vertical scroll bug.
- Fixed slight window clipping on 16x16 tile backgrounds.
- Added automatic PAL/NTSC mode switching.
- Fixed background and sprites so only visible if on main-screen or
  on sub-screen under correct circumstance.
- Fixed lockup bug in DMA.
- Stopped NMI flag from being reset by reading $4210 - was causing a couple
  of games to get stuck.
- Whoops, got horizontal and vertical Mode 7 flip bits around the wrong way!
- Fixed MIT shared memory pixmap support for X11 version (it was always turned
  off).
- Fixed minor bug - first sprite in priority group was drawn twice. Didn't
  cause any visual bugs, it just slowed down redrawing a little.
- Fixed DMA bug - transfer byte count should be 0 after DMA has finished.
- Fixed a scaling bug if width < height.
- Interleaved ROM image support added.
- 16bit and 24bit X11 server support added - with scaling.
- Added window scaling on X11 version.
- Partial clip windows added - the only window overlap option implemented at
  the moment is OR, it seems it good enough for all the ROMs I've tested
  it with.
- Partial Mosaic effect added (pixels only growing vertically).
- Missing Mode 7 "outside screen area" option added.
- Fixed mode 7 screen wrap "outside screen area" option.
- Used new event processing to finally fix H-IRQ so it triggers at the
  correct position on the scan line.
- New event processing added.
- Linux version now statically links libgz.so (sorry).
0.5 released
- Linux S-VGA version changed from using a 320x240 ModeX screen (slow) to a
  256x256 chunky screen (faster) - thanks to Phillip Ezolt (pe28+@andrew.cmu.edu)
  for information on how to do this.
- Mode 7 screen flipping added.
- Included Snes97's CPU emulation code into Snes96. Didn't fix any bugs but
  slowed down the emulation some what and I couldn't compile it optimised
  because it was so large - so I removed it again.
- Added a few extra features available via the keyboard.
- Fixed a H-DMA transfer mode - bad documentation.
- Fixed H-DMA indirect addressing (it was using the wrong CPU memory bank).
- The Linux slow down bug is my crappy laptop enabling battery saving features !
- Changed graphics code to perform true line-by-line screen updates.
- Fixed sprite drawing bugs.
- Ported Snes97's graphics code to Snes96.
- Fixed memory map for HiROM save RAM area.
- Fixed HiROM memory map - now Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong County work !
- OK the slow down bug is just actually my laptop trying to save battery
  power by slowing the CPU clock!
- The Linux slow down bug shows itself on DOS emulators running under DOSEMU
  so it must be a kernel problem (or feature).
- Fixed H-DMA (again) to be complete emulation - all I need now is line-by-line
  screen update...
- Fixed DMA to not copy too many bytes if byte count was not a multiple of
  the transfer mode quantity (caused corruption on Super Mario World map screen).
- Changed mapping of keyboard to joy-pad buttons and added additional
  direction keys for joy-pad one so player one's right hand doesn't have to
  obscure player two's keyboard joy-pad buttons.
- Changed joystick button layout to match SNES if using a 6 button joy-pad.
- Changed snapshot format so I can easily use libgz on Linux.
- Added few speed up tweaks that will be lost again when I add line-by-line
  screen update.
- First visible scan-line changed from 8 to 1 to match with new docs.
- New SNES information source found; fixed partial H-DMA emulation to include
  indirect addressing support.
- Snapshot files are now compressed.
- Compressed ROM images now supported on Linux.
- Snapshot loading and saving added.
- Joystick support for Linux added. One 2, 4 or 6 button joystick, or two 2
  button joysticks supported (PC hardware limitation).
- SVGA full screen support added for Linux. Still has the X11 slow down bug so
  can't blame the X11 server any more! Must be a kernel bug or a very odd
  emulator bug.
- Added emulation of two joy-pads on the PC/Sun keyboard.
- Removed -i command line flag as it is no longer used. -h value range has also
  changed: now 1 - 100 (percentage).
- Actuate cycle counting rather than instruction counting now added including
  fast and slow ROM timing - should give much better timing information when
  line-by-line screen update added.
- Bug fixed old-style joy-pad access used by some ROMs - Mario All Stars still
  gives problems if enabled and I don't know why; but at least Super Bomberman
  now works !
- Looks like if both horizontal and vertical IRQ are enabled then IRQ should
  only be triggered once per frame and not once per scan line - looking at the
  IRQ handler of a couple of ROMs seems to confirm this.
- Added initial cycle counting - not accurate enough for some ROMs though.
- Finally worked out how the odd VRAM address increments should work but only
  found one ROM, so far, that actually uses it.
- Debugged the odd slow down problem with the Linux port - it seems to be a
  bug in the X Window System server - starve the X server of keyboard presses
  or mouse clicks or movement and the X server slows down, slowing down the
  emulator with it !
0.4 released
- Fixed sprite vertical clipping at top of screen.
- No need to invert the Mode 7 transformation matrix before use - the
  ROM coder already had to!
- Fixed Mode 7 scrolling offset when using special effects.
- Added Mode 7 rotation, enlargement and reduction emulation.
- DMA shouldn't zero the byte count value after a DMA has completed.
- Added DMA reading (Addams Family was using it)
- Fixed V-RAM read function - returned data should lag behind the V-RAM
  address by one byte/word.
- Added mode 7 graphics only.
0.3 released
- Speeded up the main CPU loop a bit.
- Add more command line options:
  -f <frame skip> (default 1)
  -i <no instructions between polling X> (default 32768)
  -h <number instructions per scan line> (default 45, some games allow a lower
					  setting resulting in a increased
					  emulated frame rate)
  -t enable CPU tracing
  -ss <sound CPU skip wait method> (default 0, more methods to be added)
  -H disable H-DMA emulation
  -F Force Hi-ROM memory map
- Modified planar to chunky conversion to use look up tables.
- But now Mario All Stars won't start. Made emulation of $4016 optional with
  -o command line switch.
- Thanks to Carlos (calb) of ESNES fame, I've added correct $4016 & $4017
  joy-pad register processing - now several more ROMs will start once a
  button is pressed and can be controlled.
- DMA wasn't updating DMA registers with the final CPU address used after the
  DMA had completed (caused sprite and background corruption with some ROMs).
  Still suspect another DMA side effect isn't being emulated correctly though.
- Fixed setting of CPU overflow flag in ADC and SBC instructions in decimal
  mode.
- Fixed MVP/MVN CPU instructions to leave X and Y values correct at end of
  loop - several more ROMs now work. Still don't know if MVP/MVN instructions
  should ignore the accumulator size flag or not.
- Rewrote background drawing code - gives a large increase in speed.
- Flag to only update X Windows colour palette when necessary was missing a
  case - caused some ROMs to start with a black screen.
- Code to only update background tiles when changed wasn't working so I
  disabled it.
- CPU WAI instruction needed to trigger on hardware IRQ even when interrupt
  enable flag was false.
- DMA was not transferring 65536 bytes when byte count was 0.
- Fixed matrix 16bit x 8bit multiplication (old debug code was causing junk
  value to be returned).
- Fixed Makefile so version.h header file change recompiles file that shows
  version number in window title.
- Added more reporting of used but unimplemented missing hardware features to
  debug command.
- New ROM loading code from Jerremy included, can now cope with ROM images
  with no 512 byte header.
- Speeded up emulated memory access a little bit.
0.2 released
- Added matrix 16bit x 8bit multiplication for Super Off-Road Racer.
- Added initial H-DMA emulation - visual effects using it will not be seen
  correctly until screen is updated line-by-line rather than the whole screen
  at end-of-frame.
- Fixed horizontal sprite clipping (vertical clipping still has a problem).
- Integrated large sprite bug fixes and new background drawing code from
  Jerremy.
- Fixed large size per-sprite flag; always stayed true after sprite size was
  changed to large.
- Rewrote the planar to chunky pixel conversion routines (still need more
  work).
- Made registers $4016 & $4017 always return $ff - lots of ROMs that previously
  wouldn't go beyond the title screen thought old-style joy-pads were
  connected and were waiting for the user to press a button on them.
- Frame skip rate now set to 1 instead of 5 on my P166 laptop!
- Fixed NMI v-blank flag being incorrect set, caused some ROMs to lock.
- X keyboard autorepeat now switched off when emulator has keyboard focus.
- Added number key options to toggle backgrounds 1 to 4 and objs (sprites) on
  and off.
- Fixed sprite clipping problems at edge of left hand side of screen.
- Corrected Hi-ROM memory map (I think) (no I didn't)
- Fixed most of the sprite-to-sprite priority problems.
- Added sprite debug command, 'S'.
- Added a debug command to show what missing hardware features a ROM was using.
- Added horizontal and vertical beam position IRQ - horizontal always triggers
  at start of line at the moment.
- Fixed SBC instruction to set carry flag the correct way around.
Initial release 0.1
- Ported Windows 95 version of Snes96 to Linux on a PC and Solaris on a
  SparcStation.
- Corrected work RAM memory map.
