= Core Parameters =

These are standard parameters which are used by the Mupen64Plus Core library.  They are stored in a configuration section called "Core" and may be altered by the front-end in order to adjust the behaviour of the emulator.  These may be adjusted at any time and the effect of the change should occur immediately.

These configuration parameters are used in the Core's event loop to detect keyboard and joystick commands.  They are stored in a configuration section called "CoreEvents" and may be altered by the front-end in order to adjust the behaviour of the emulator.  These may be adjusted at any time and the effect of the change should occur immediately.  The Keysym value stored is actually <tt>(SDLMod << 16) || SDLKey</tt>, so that keypresses with modifiers like shift, control, or alt may be used.

These configuration parameters are used in the Core's event loop to detect joystick commands.

The command strings use a simple format described here. Note that you cannot have any spaces in the command string.  For commands activated by pressing a joystick axis, the format is "J'''x'''A'''y'''+" or "J'''x'''A'''y'''-", where '''x''' is the SDL joystick number (must be between 0 and 9) and '''y''' is the axis number.  For the last character, '''+''' represents movement in the positive direction, while '''-''' represents movement in the negative direction.  For commands activated by pressing a button, the format is "J'''x'''B'''y'''", where '''x''' is the SDL joystick number (must be between 0 and 9) and '''y''' is the button number.  For commands activated by pressing a ''hat'' (a directional switch) on the joystick, the format is "J'''x'''H'''y'''V'''z'''", where '''x''' is the SDL joystick number (must be between 0 and 9), '''y''' is the hat number, and '''z''' is the hat value.  The hat value corresponds with the SDL_HAT_ enumerated types: Up is 1, Right is 2, Down is 4, and Left is 8.  For diagonal directions, these values may be ''or''d together.

After the 2.5 release, several new features were added to these Joystick Mapping command strings.  You can now specify more than one joystick action which will activate a given command.  To specify several actions, use a comma-separated string containing multiple action phrases as given above ("J'''x'''A'''y'''+" or "J'''x'''B'''y'''" or "J'''x'''H'''y'''V'''z'''").  Make sure there are no spaces in your command string.  Another new feature is that the "*" character can be used as a wildcard in the '''x''' joystick number field in order to activate this command for any joystick.  Finally, you can also use a hotkey specifier to require that two distinct joystick actions must be pressed simultaneously in order to activate a command.  The format for the hoykey feature is like "J'''x'''''Action''/''Action''" where ''Action'' is either "A'''y'''+", "A'''y'''-", "B'''y'''", or "H'''y'''V'''z'''".

Here's an example of a joystick command parameter which uses all three of these new features:

<pre>Joy Mapping Stop = "J0B6,J*B9,J1B5/A0-"</pre>

With this joystick event string, the emulator will shut down when joystick 0 button 6 is pressed, or when button 9 is pressed on any joystick, or when button 5 is pressed on joystick 1 at the same time as axis 0 is moved left.
