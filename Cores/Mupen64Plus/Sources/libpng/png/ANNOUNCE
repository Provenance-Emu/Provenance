Changes from version 1.6.47 to version 1.6.48
---------------------------------------------

 * Fixed the floating-point version of the mDCv setter `png_set_mDCv`.
   (Reported by Mohit Bakshi; fixed by John Bowler)
 * Added #error directives to discourage the inclusion of private
   libpng implementation header files in PNG-supporting applications.
 * Added the CMake build option `PNG_LIBCONF_HEADER`, to be used as an
   alternative to `DFA_XTRA`.
 * Removed the Travis CI configuration files, with heartfelt thanks for
   their generous support of our project over the past five years!
