 * STATUS: SUPPORTED
 * BUG REPORTS: png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net
 *
 * png_have_rvv implemented for Linux by reading the widely available
 * pseudo-file /proc/cpuinfo.
 *
 * This code is strict ANSI-C and is probably moderately portable; it does
 * however use <stdio.h> and it assumes that /proc/cpuinfo is never localized.
