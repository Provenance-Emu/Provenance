This means you can still modify some of these options afterwards but they are now automatically set/unset when loading a game which need
special timing fixes. These fixes are also automatically desactivated when the current game doesn't need them.
For information, games that are actually detected and need special timings to run properly are:
 .Legend of Galahad & Road Rash series (single line not rendered properly)
 .Sesame Street Counting Cafe (don't boot)
 .Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune (graphic glitches on scrolling)
