HISTORY of the LZMA SDK
-----------------------

16.04          2016-10-04
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed in DllSecur.c.


16.03          2016-09-28
-------------------------
- SFX modules now use some protection against DLL preloading attack.
- Some bugs in 7z code were fixed.


16.02          2016-05-21
-------------------------
- The BUG in 16.00 - 16.01 was fixed:
  Split Handler (SplitHandler.cpp) returned incorrect 
  total size value (kpidSize) for split archives.


16.01          2016-05-19
-------------------------	
- Some internal changes to reduce the number of compiler warnings.


16.00          2016-05-10
-------------------------	
- Some bugs were fixed.


15.12          2015-11-19
-------------------------	
- The BUG in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zDec.c : SzDecodeLzma2()
  7z decoder could mistakenly report about decoding error for some 7z archives
  that use LZMA2 compression method.
  The probability to get that mistaken decoding error report was about 
  one error per 16384 solid blocks for solid blocks larger than 16 KB (compressed size). 
- The BUG (in 9.26-15.11) in C version of 7z decoder was fixed:
  7zArcIn.c : SzReadHeader2()
  7z decoder worked incorrectly for 7z archives that contain 
  empty solid blocks, that can be placed to 7z archive, if some file is 
  unavailable for reading during archive creation.


15.09 beta     2015-10-16
-------------------------	
- The BUG in LZMA / LZMA2 encoding code was fixed.
  The BUG in LzFind.c::MatchFinder_ReadBlock() function.
  If input data size is larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size),
  the following code worked incorrectly:
  -  LZMA : LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() : LZMA encoding functions 
     for compressing from memory to memory. 
     That BUG is not related to LZMA encoder version that works via streams.
  -  LZMA2 : multi-threaded version of LZMA2 encoder worked incorrectly, if 
     default value of chunk size (CLzma2EncProps::blockSize) is changed 
     to value larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size).


9.38 beta      2015-01-03
-------------------------	
- The BUG in 9.31-9.37 was fixed:
  IArchiveGetRawProps interface was disabled for 7z archives.
- The BUG in 9.26-9.36 was fixed:
  Some code in CPP\7zip\Archive\7z\ worked correctly only under Windows.


9.36 beta      2014-12-26
-------------------------	
- The BUG in command line version was fixed:
  7-Zip created temporary archive in current folder during update archive
  operation, if -w{Path} switch was not specified. 
  The fixed 7-Zip creates temporary archive in folder that contains updated archive.
- The BUG in 9.33-9.35 was fixed:
  7-Zip silently ignored file reading errors during 7z or gz archive creation,
  and the created archive contained only part of file that was read before error.
  The fixed 7-Zip stops archive creation and it reports about error.


9.35 beta      2014-12-07

-------------------------
