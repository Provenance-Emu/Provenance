# libchdr

libchdr is a standalone library for reading MAME's CHDv1-v5 formats.

The code is based off of MAME's old C codebase which read up to CHDv4 with OS-dependent features removed, and CHDv5 support backported from MAME's current C++ codebase.

libchdr is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)) and uses third party libraries that are each distributed under their own terms (see each library's license in [deps/](deps/)).
