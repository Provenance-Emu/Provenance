Goals for a 1.0.0 release
--------------------------
-Full "stock" saturn emulation. At the very least it should be "feature complete"(most major bugs should be fixed at this point too)
-Any external carts or peripheral do not need to be fully emulated at this point
-Switchable SH2 Dynarec/Interpreter cores
-Full debugging support
-Speed should be high at this point(It's too tough ironing out those bugs with Yabause at its current state)
-Save States
