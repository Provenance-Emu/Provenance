Mednafen Network Play Server v0.5.0
------------------------------------

***IMPORTANT***
This network play server will work best on LANs, or small-scale WANs.
It will work on the Internet, but...physics might not be in your
favor.
***END IMPORTANT***

To compile, type "./configure" and if nothing went wrong, "make".  To compile under MS Windows, you should use Cygwin.  I'm not
going to change this server to use Win-old-dirty-smelly-sock natively.

If it doesn't compile, sell your <eternally lasting essence of self> to the 
<evil entity of your religion>.

Most beings can run it like "./mednafen-server standard.conf >logfile &".
Windows users can run it some other way.  A batch file with absolute paths, perhaps?
	snuggums.bat:
		C:\somethingdirectory\mednafen-server.exe c:\somethingdirectory\standard.conf

With the default settings, each client should use about 65-70Kbps, excluding any
data transferred during chat, state loads, etc.

Clients connecting with high-latency or slow links may use more bandwidth, or they
may use less bandwidth.  I'm really not quite sure.  If it concerns you, test it.

Any client connecting over VERY high latency links, such as bidirectional satellite connections,
may find that attempting network play will lock up his/her connection for 
several minutes.  Right, Disch. ;)

The server probably won't scale well to a huge number of clients connected at the same time.

Bumping up the server's priority and running it on a low-latency kernel(preferably with
1 ms or smaller timeslices) should help make network play more usable if you're running the 
network play server on an otherwise non-idle physical server.


When run, you'll likely get a warning such as the following:
	Note: mlockall(MCL_CURRENT) failed: Cannot allocate memory (not a major problem; see the documentation if curious)
It's not strictly necessary for the mlockall() to succeed, but having it succeed can greatly improve worst-case latency on systems that
use swap space.  You'll need to increase the user's maximum locked memory resource limit, such as via "ulimit" or "limits.conf"(IE
/etc/security/limits.conf on a Debian system).  However, ideally, you would run the server on a system that forgoes swap usage.


TODO:

Send emulation info, such as NTSC/PAL, input devices, and Game Genie emulation at connect
time, to make it easier on end users.
