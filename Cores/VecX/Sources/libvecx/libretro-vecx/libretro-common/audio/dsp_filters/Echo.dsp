# Somewhat fancy Echo filter. Can take any number of echo channels with varying delays (ms) and feedback factors.
# Echo output from all channels can be fed back into each other to create a somewhat reverb-like effect if desired.

# Defaults, 200 ms delay echo with feedback:
# Delay in ms. Takes an array with multiple channels.
# echo_delay = "200"
# Feedback factor for echo.
# echo_feedback = "0.5"
# Overall echo amplification. If too high, the echo becomes unstable due to feedback.
# echo_amp = "0.2"

# Reverby preset.
# echo_delay    = " 60  80 120 172 200 320 380"
# echo_feedback = "0.5 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.5 0.3 0.2"

# echo_amp = "0.12"
