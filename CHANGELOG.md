### Added

- Code Signing is now managed with an XCConfig file. See `CodeSigning.xcconfig.example` for instructions. (Only applies to developers/xcode source installs)
- Native Metal renderer option [WIP/Buggy]
- Metal Shaders (CRT, LCD, etc.)
- Sega Saturn Mutli-CD support
- N64: Dual Shock 4 touchpad as pause
- N64: option for Dual Joysticks on DualShock4 as dual controllers (allows Goldeneye dual controller joystock layout from 1 physical dualshock)
- enumeration options
- radio selection options
- per-game option overrides
- Jaguar options exposed
- N64 mupen/gliden/rice options exposed
- Swift UI/UIKit optional code paths at app start (SwiftUI currernly empty, for easier development in future)
- Mednafen: SNESFaust 1 frame render ahead option (on by default. VERY SNAPPY!)
- Mednafen : many more sub-core options added
- Localizations : Chinese Simplifed, Spanish (Only Partially translated WIP)
- Support new Apple TV Siri remote (MicroGamepad and DirectionalGamepad)
- NSLocalizedString for most strings in main app source
- Long press a ROM for quick access to Core Options
- FPS debug label now includes total CPU and Memory usage.
- GameBoy Advanced cheat code support
- APIs for keyboard, mouse, rumble, on-screen joystick. (coming in future release)
- VirtualBoy side by side mode (for 3D tv's with Side by Side mode. Google Cardboard coming later)
- XCode will present a warning message if it detects a device build but CodeSigning.xcconfig isn't setup.

### Improved

- If multiple cores support a system, cores are listed in recommended order.
- Improved logo/header bar for iOS & tvOS
- Branch prediction compiler hints for tight loops, possibly faster.
- Fix some excessive thread blocks
- Replace all spinlocks with atomic operations for better thread performance
- mupen faster controller polling, various other code speedup tweaks.
- mupen llvm optimization flags improved (was incorrectly -O2, now -Os)
- replaced some sloppy force unwraps with proper nil checks and logging
- Shaders are copied to Documents at load and read from thereafter. This allows locally editing / developing shaders without rebuilding.
- Catalyst: All cores build now for Intel and M1.
- Dark Mode UI always on, fixes some color issues
- Mupen wrapper code organized, refactored
- Jaguar button layout tweaks
- Converted more app code from ObjC to Swift
- check if file exists before attempt to delete, reduces superfulous throws trapping in the debugger
- Mark various ObjC classes `objc_direct_members`. Should improve Swift to ObjC calls bypassing dynamic dispatch for function pointers (in theory)
### Fixed

- Conflicts better detected
- tvOS top buttons sometimes couldn't be selected
- Faster compile times (improved header imports, compiler flags)
- Fixed some improper retain cycles in ObjC blocks
- Fixed rare audio engine nil reference race condition crash
- Cheat entry UI fixes

### Updated

- N64: Swap left and right triggers to L:Start R:Z Button from other way around prior

- Improved tvOS UI (top buttons, search, icons, more consistant styling)
- mupen cxd4 plugin to latest upstream version
- mupen rsp-hle pluring to latest upstream version

Special thanks and shout-outs to @braindx, @error404-na, @zydeco, @mrjschulte, @yoshisuga, the Mupen team and all of the additional contributors.

**N64 Release!** with Mupen64Plus + GlideN64 ‚Äî a non-jailbreak emulation _first._ A lot in this update: Swift codebase conversion, Atari Jaguar support, Saturn, Dreamcast‚Ä¶full _multi-disc support_ for all of you RPG fans out there, dark theme default, 60 FPS optimizations, core updates, new touch controls, iOS 12, iPhone X, WebDAV support and _much more‚Ä¶_

‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking** ‚ö†Ô∏è

2.0 does not support upgrading from 1.4 libraries. It MAY work with some versions of 1.5beta's but not all betas are the same. Your mileage may vary. For this reason we're updating the version to 2.0, to indicate the lack of upgrade path. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è *You can install 2.0 along side 1.x by using a different bundle id*
