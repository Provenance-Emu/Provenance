Level 1 archives:

l1_lh0.lzh         - Uncompressed (-lh0-) archive.
l1_lh1.lzh         - Old LHarc compression algorithm (-lh1-) archive.
l1_lh5.lzh         - Standard LHA compression algorithm (-lh5-).
l1_nm_lh5.lzh      - -lh5- archive generated with the "non-Mac" menu item.
l1_subdir.lzh      - Archive containing a subdirectory ("partial" path).
l1_full_subdir.lzh - Archive with "full" path including volume name.

There are equivalent level 0 and level 2 archives with l0_ and l2_ prefixes.
There are no subdirectory archives for level 0, as MacLHA will not generate
level 0 archives containing path names.

All archives except the "_nm_" archives contain MacBinary headers at the
start of the compressed data. The "_subdir" archives have files made in
the Mac OS "TeachText" application and therefore have MacBinary headers
that contain meaningful information. They also have non-matching
creation and modification times.
