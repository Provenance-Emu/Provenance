Archives for regression testing.

abspath.lzh         - Archive containing a file with an absolute path.  For
                      security reasons, file extraction should always be done
                      relative to the extraction path.  If extraction to
                      absolute paths was permitted, it would potentially allow
                      arbitrary files on the filesystem to be overwritten.

badterm.lzh         - Archive containing a file that includes an unsafe
                      terminal escape sequence (changes the title in the
                      terminal window). This terminal escape sequence should
                      not appear in list output.

dir.lzh             - Archive that just contains a directory.

multiple.lzh        - Archive containing multiple stored files with different
                      names, for testing wildcard pattern matching.

truncated.lzh       - Unexpectedly truncated -lh5- archive.

unixsep.lzh         - Archive containing a level 0 header where the filename
                      has a path separated with Unix-style path separators
                      ('/') instead of DOS-style ('\'). This file is manually
                      constructed, but archives like this do exist in the wild.

symlink1.lzh        - Symbolic link test. The archive contains a file named
                      foo.txt twice - firstly as a symbolic link to bar.txt,
                      and then as an actual file. Extraction should not
                      create bar.txt, or arbitrary files could be overwritten
                      by a maliciously constructed archive file.

symlink2.lzh        - This archive contains a symbolic link with '..' in the
                      target, and a file that tries to use that symlink to
                      overwrite files outside the extract directory.

symlink3.lzh        - This archive contains a symbolic link with an absolute
                      path, and a file that tries to use the symlink to
                      overwrite files outside the extract directory.

dotdot.lzh          - Archive containing paths with '..'. This could be used
                      to break out of the extract directory and overwrite
                      arbitrary files on the filesystem.
