This version of LHA has support for different header levels, but it seems
to be buggy?

level0.lzh    - Archive with level 0 header.
level1.lzh    - Archive with level 1 header. Unix LHA can't read it?
level2.lzh    - Archive with level 2 header. Unix LHA gets confused by path?

Bug test archive:

lh0_dirs_bug.lzh - File where a directory entry is mistakenly encoded as a
                   zero-length file with -lh0- compression method (Lhasa
                   bug #31). Thanks to Github user @alfredone for supplying
                   this. I don't actually know what version of the LhA tool
                   generated this file and has this bug, this directory was
                   just a convenient place to put it.
