These are archive files generated by PMarc v1.24 for CP/M, by
Yoshihiko Mino (PMARC124.PMA).

Test archive files:

  pm0.pma         - Uncompressed (-pm0-) file.
  pm1.pma         - Text file compressed using -pm1- compression.
  pm1_long.pma    - Long text file in -pm1- format.

  mtcd.pma        - Archive with compressed -pm1- format files.
                    This was found in the wild as a problem archive and
                    is included as fair use. I'm not sure what version
                    of PMarc was used to generate this.

                    This contains two archived files. mtcd.doc needs
                    deliberate padding with EOF bytes for the CRC to
                    extract correctly. cd.mtc does not.
