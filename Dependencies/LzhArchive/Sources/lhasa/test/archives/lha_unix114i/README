Archives generated using the Unix LHA tool, from the Debian package
(version 1.14i-10.3).

The following are files with level 1 header (with the -1 command
line option). Equivalent files also exist for level 0 and 2 headers.

  h1_lh0.lzh      - Archive containing uncompressed (stored) file.
  h1_lh5.lzh      - Archive containing compressed file (-lh5-: -o5 option)
  h1_lh6.lzh      - Archive containing compressed file (-lh6-: -o6 option)
  h1_lh7.lzh      - Archive containing compressed file (-lh7-: -o7 option)
  h1_subdir.lzh   - Archive containing subdirectories.
                    This archive has specially chosen permissions - the file
                    is contained in a directory without write permissions.
                    The archive therefore has to be extracted carefully,
                    with the directory's contents extracted before the
                    permissions on it are set.  The Unix LHA tool, although
                    it was used to create this archive, fails to extract it.
  h1_symlink.lzh  - Archive containing a Unix symbolic link.
  h1_symlink2.lzh - Archive containing a symbolic link that contains a path
                    separator. Relevant because the symbolic link is split
                    across the filename and path headers.
  h1_symlink3.lzh - Archive containing a symbolic link located inside a
                    subdirectory.

h0_subdir.lzh is broken - because of the header level, the filenames are
empty.

In addition, there are also these:

  lh6_long.lzh - Large -lh6- compressed file.
  lh7_long.lzh - Large -lh7- compressed file.
