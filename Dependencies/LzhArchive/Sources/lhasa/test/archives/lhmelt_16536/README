These archives are generated using LHMelt v1.65.3.6 (lmlzh32.dll v2.67.1.2).
It is also possible to use it with unlha32.dll instead, but the generated
archives appear to be identical. The following files have level 0 headers:

  h0_lh0.lzh        - Stored (-lh0-) file.
  h0_lh1.lzh        - Compressed (-lh1-) file.
  h0_lh5.lzh        - Compressed (-lh5-) file.
  h0_lh6.lzh        - Compressed (-lh6-) file.
  h0_lh7.lzh        - Compressed (-lh7-) file.
  h0_subdir.lzh     - Archive containing a file with a path. This was
                      generated with the "use root dir" option turned on
                      and the recursive button pressed, so that an entry
                      was stored for the parent directory.

Equivalent archives with level 1 and 2 headers have h1_ and h2_ prefixes.

The following are self-extracting archives. Technically, these don't seem
to specifically be associated with LHmelt (unlha32.dll?) but this seems
like an appropriate place to put them.
