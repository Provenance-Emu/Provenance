The full change history is maintained in git. Rather than reproduce
the change history history here, it's easier if you clone a copy of
the git repository and view it:

    git clone git://github.com/fragglet/lhasa.git lhasa
    cd lhasa
    git log

Alternatively, the commit history can be viewed on github:

    https://github.com/fragglet/lhasa/commits/master
