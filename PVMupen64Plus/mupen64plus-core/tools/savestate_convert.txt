savestate_convert.txt - Mupen64Plus - July 12th, 2008

This conversion tool was written to help users migrate their savestate files
when there are changes to the savestate file format which break backward
compatibility.

To compile the conversion tool, open a console window, go to the root of your
Mupen64Plus source code, and type:

gcc -o savestate_convert -lz tools/savestate_convert.c

This will create a small command-line application called 'savestate_convert'.
This program takes only one command-line parameter, which is a path to the
savestate file that you want to update.  The old savestate file will be
overwritten with the new one, so you may wish to first make a backup copy
of the savestate file.  If you update a savestate file to a newer version,
older versions of Mupen64Plus will not be able to load it.

If you wish to update all of the savestate files in your home directory, you
may do so with the following bash command:

for file in ~/.mupen64plus/save/*.st*; do ./savestate_convert "${file}"; done
