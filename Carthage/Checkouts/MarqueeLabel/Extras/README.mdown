Extras
======

A collection of subclasses, extensions, and modifications for MarqueeLabel to implement various
functionality that has been requested or suggested, but not merged into the MarqueeLabel code.

Keep in mind, these extras probably work...but may not work well. **Expect minimal or no support**, unanticipated edge cases, bugs, and more! You'll need to figure these out for yourself.

- **NoReturnAnimation** (Swift) - A modification to the LeftRight/RightLeft types that "cancels" the returnportion of the animation, so that the label jumps back to the home position after scrolling away (see issue #153). Added 24 Oct 2016.

- **SingleShotOffscreenLabel** (Swift) - Similar to NoReturnAnimation, but the label scrolls offscreen and does not return to the home position (see issue #168). Added 24 Oct 2016.
