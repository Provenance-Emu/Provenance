/**
 The feedback module.
 
 This is the HockeySDK module for letting your users communicate directly with you via
 the app and an integrated user interface. It provides a single threaded
 discussion with a user running your app.
 
 You should never create your own instance of `BITFeedbackManager` but use the one provided
 by the `[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager]`:
 
     [BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].feedbackManager

 The user interface provides a list view that can be presented modally using
 `[BITFeedbackManager showFeedbackListView]` or adding
 `[BITFeedbackManager feedbackListViewController:]` to push onto a navigation stack.
 This list integrates all features to load new messages, write new messages, view messages
 and ask the user for additional (optional) data like name and email.
 
 If the user provides the email address, all responses from the server will also be sent
 to the user via email and the user is also able to respond directly via email, too.
 
 The message list interface also contains options to locally delete single messages
 by swiping over them, or deleting all messages. This will not delete the messages
 on the server, though!
 
 It also integrates actions to invoke the user interface to compose a new message,
 reload the list content from the server and change the users name or email if these
 are allowed to be set.
 
 It is also possible to invoke the user interface to compose a new message in your
 own code, by calling `[BITFeedbackManager showFeedbackComposeView]` modally or adding
 `[BITFeedbackManager feedbackComposeViewController]` to push onto a navigation stack.
 
 If new messages are written while the device is offline, the SDK automatically retries to
 send them once the app starts again or gets active again, or if the notification
 `BITHockeyNetworkDidBecomeReachableNotification` is fired.
 
 A third option is to include the `BITFeedbackActivity` into an UIActivityViewController.
 This can be useful if you present some data that users can not only share but also
 report back to the developer because they have some problems, e.g. webcams not working
 any more. The activity provides a default title and image that can also be customized.

 New messages are automatically loaded on startup, when the app becomes active again
 or when the notification `BITHockeyNetworkDidBecomeReachableNotification` is fired. This
 only happens if the user ever did initiate a conversation by writing the first
 feedback message. The app developer has to fire this notification to trigger another retry
 when it detects the device having network access again. The SDK only retries automatically
 when the app becomes active again.
 
 Implementing the `BITFeedbackManagerDelegate` protocol will notify your app when a new
 message was received from the server. The `BITFeedbackComposeViewControllerDelegate`
 protocol informs your app about events related to sending feedback messages.
