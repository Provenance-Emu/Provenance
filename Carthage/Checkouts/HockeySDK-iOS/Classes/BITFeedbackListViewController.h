/**
 View controller providing a default interface to manage feedback

 The message list interface contains options to locally delete single messages
 by swiping over them, or deleting all messages. This will not delete the messages
 on the server though!
 
 It is also integrates actions to invoke the user interface to compose a new messages,
 reload the list content from the server and changing the users name or email if these
 are allowed to be set.
 
 To add this view controller to your own app and push it onto a navigation stack,
 don't create the instance yourself, but use the following code to get a correct instance:
 
     [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].feedbackManager feedbackListViewController:NO]
 
 To show it modally, use the following code instead:

     [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].feedbackManager feedbackListViewController:YES]
 
 This ensures that the presentation on iOS 6 and iOS 7 will use the current design on each OS Version.
