#ifndef PLCRASH_FEATURE_MACH_EXCEPTIONS
/**
 * If true, enable Mach exception support. On Mac OS X, the Mach exception implementation is fully supported,
 * using publicly available API. On iOS, the APIs required for a complete implementation are not public. However, a
 * popular commercial crash reporter is now shipping with support for Mach exceptions, which implies that either
 * they've received special dispensation to use private APIs / private structures, they've found another way to do
 * it, or they're just using undocumented functionality and hoping for the best.
 *
 * The exposed surface of undocumented API usage is relatively low, and there has been strong user demand to
 * implement Mach exception handling regardless of concerns over API visiblity. Given this, we've enabled
 * Mach exception handling by default, and provided both build-time and runtime configuration
 * to disable its use.
 *
 * For more information on the potential issues with enabling mach exception support, @sa @ref mach_exceptions.
