     * PLCrashReporter's signal handler will supersede previously registered handlers; existing
     * handlers will not be called. This behavior may be modified in a future release, and should
     * not be relied upon as a mechanism to prevent existing signal handlers from being called.
     *
     * There are some limitations to signal-based crash handling on Mac OS X and iOS; specifically:
     *
     * - On Mac OS X, stack overflows will only be handled on the thread on which
     *   the crash reporter was initialized. This should generally be the main thread.
     * - On iOS 6.0 and later, any stack overflows will not be handled due to sigaltstack() being
     *   non-functional on the device. (see rdar://13002712 - SA_ONSTACK/sigaltstack() ignored on iOS).
     * - Some exit paths in Apple's Libc will deregister a signal handler before firing SIGABRT, resulting
     *   in the signal handler never being called (see rdar://14313497 - ___abort() disables SIGABRT signal
     *   handlers prior to raising SIGABRT).  These __abort()-based checks are:
     *     - Implemented for unsafe memcpy/strcpy/snprintf C functions.
     *     - Only enabled when operating on a fixed-width target buffer (in which case the
     *       compiler rewrites the function calls to the built-in variants, and provides the fixed-width length as an argument).
     *     - Only trigger in the case that the source data exceeds the size of the fixed width target
     *       buffer, and the maximum length argument either isn't supplied by the caller (eg, when using strcpy),
     *       or a too-long argument is supplied (eg, strncpy with a length argument longer than the target buffer),
     *       AND that argument can't be checked at compile-time.

     * If any existing Mach exception server has been registered for the task, exceptions will be forwarded to that
     * exception handler. Should the exceptions be handled by an existing handler, no report will be generated
     * by PLCrashReporter.
     *
     * @par Mac OS X
     *
     * On Mac OS X, the Mach exception implementation is fully supported, using publicly available API -- note,
     * however, that some kernel-internal constants, as well as architecture-specific trap information,
     * may be required to fully interpret a Mach exception's root cause.
     *
     * @par iOS
     *
     * On iOS, the APIs required for a complete implementation are not fully public.
     *
     * The exposed surface of undocumented API usage is relatively low, and there has been strong user demand to
     * implement Mach exception handling regardless of concerns over API visiblity. Given this, we've included
     * Mach exception handling as an optional feature, with both build-time and runtime configuration
     * to disable its inclusion or use, respectively.
     *
     * @par Debugger Incompatibility
     *
     * The Mach exception handler executes in-process, and will interfere with debuggers when they attempt to
     * suspend all active threads (which will include the Mach exception handler). Mach-based handling
     * should not be used when a debugger is attached.
     *
     * @par More Details
     *
     * For more information, refer to @ref mach_exceptions.

/**
 * @ingroup enums

 * Local symbolication is performed using inexact heuristics and symbol data available at runtime; it may
 * return information that is incorrect. This may still be useful in the case where DWARF data is unavailable
 * for a given build; in that case, it can provide function and method names (though not line numbers) for a
 * crash report that may otherwise be unusable.
 *
 * Note, however, this comes at the cost of a significant increase in code that must run within the critical
 * crash reporting section, where failures may result in crash reports being corrupted or left unwritten. In
 * addition, some of the provided symbolication strategies rely on knowledge of runtime internals that may
 * change in future iOS releases. Given that DWARF symbolication data will <em>always</em> be more accurate, and
 * the risks inherent in executing considerably more code at crash time, it is strongly recommended that local
 * symbolication only be enabled for non-release builds.
 *
 * Multiple symbolication strategies may be enabled, in which case a best-match heuristic will be applied to the
 * results.
