## 4.1.1

**Attention** Due to changes in iOS 10, it is now necessary to include the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your app's Info.plist file if you want to use HockeySDK's Feedback feature. Since using the feature without the plist key present could lead to an App Store rejection, our default CocoaPods configuration does not include the Feedback feature anymore.
If you want to continue to use it, use this in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "HockeySDK", :subspecs => ['AllFeaturesLib']
```

Additionally, we now also provide a new flavor in our binary distribution. To use all features, including Feedback, use `HockeySDK.embeddedframework` from the `HockeySDKAllFeatures` folder.

- [NEW] The property `userDescription` on `BITCrashMetaData` had to be renamed to `userProvidedeDescription` to provide a name clash with Apple Private API

## 4.1.0-beta.2

- [BUGFIX] Fixes an issue where the whole app's Application Support directory was accidentally excluded from backups.
This SDK release explicitly includes the Application Support directory into backups. If you want to opt-out of this fix and keep the Application Directory's backup flag untouched, add the following line above the SDK setup code:

  - Objective-C:
        ```objc
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:YES forKey:@"BITExcludeApplicationSupportFromBackup"];
        ```

  - Swift:
        ```swift

As a side effect, this unfortunately breaks compatibility with Xcode 6. [#310](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS/pull/310)
- [IMPROVEMENT] Improve error detection and logging during crash processing in case the app is sent to the background while crash processing hasn't finished.[#311](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS/pull/311)

## Version 4.0.1

- [BUGFIX] Fixes an issue where the whole app's Application Support directory was accidentally excluded from backups.
This SDK release explicitly includes the Application Support directory into backups. If you want to opt-out of this fix and keep the Application Directory's backup flag untouched, add the following line above the SDK setup code:

  - Objective-C:
        ```objc
        [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:YES forKey:@"kBITExcludeApplicationSupportFromBackup"];
        ```

		  HockeyApp features will only be integrated in this new unified SDK.

		- Integration either as framework or Xcode subproject using the sourcecode
		
		  Check out [Installation & Setup](Guide-Installation-Setup)

	- [NEW] Cleaned up public interfaces and internal processing all across the SDK

	- [NEW] [AppleDoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) based documentation and HowTos
	
		This allows the documentation to be generated into HTML or DocSet.

- Crash Reporting:

	- [NEW] Workflow to handle crashes that happen on startup.
	
		Check out [How to handle crashes on startup](HowTo-Handle-Crashes-On-Startup) for more details.

	- [NEW] Symbolicate iOS calls async-safe on the device

	- [REMOVED] Settings screen

		If you want users to be able not to send analytics data, implement the

		the value depending on what the user defines in your settings UI.
