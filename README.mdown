### Building Provenance
[See the instructions on the wiki](https://github.com/jasarien/Provenance/wiki/Building-Provenance) and follow them _to the letter_. Any issues raised that clearly demonstrate that the instructions haven't been followed will be closed.

### Why 'Provenance'?

I was looking for a word with a similar meaning to Genesis and came across Provenance:

> prov·e·nance  
> */ˈprävənəns/*  
> **Noun**  
> > The beginning of something's existence; something's origin.
