# Provenance
### An iOS Frontend for multiple emulators, currently supporting Sega Genesis, Game Gear and SNES

Genesis/Game Gear emulation is provided by [Genesis Plus GX](http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/), originally written by Charles Mac Donald, and later improved by Eke-Eke. The specific implementation used in Provenance is based on the Genesis emulator core from [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org), [(source)](http://github.com/OpenEmu).
SNES emulation is provided by [SNES9x](http://www.snes9x.com). The specific implementation used in Provenance is based on the SNES emulator core from [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org), [(source)](http://github.com/OpenEmu). Playstation emulation is provided by [mednafen](http://mednafen.sourceforge.net). The specific implementation used in Provenance is based on the Playstation emulator core from [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org), [(source)](http://github.com/OpenEmu).

###Why 'Provenance'?

I was looking for a word with a similar meaning to Genesis and came across Provenance:

> prov·e·nance  
> */ˈprävənəns/*  
> **Noun**  
> > 1. The place of origin or earliest known history of something: "a rug of Iranian provenance".  
> > 2. The beginning of something's existence; something's origin.

##Features

iOS Specific features:

- All current generation iOS devices supported with iOS 8
- Configurable on-screen controls
    - Position them how you like, and adjust their opacity so they don't get in your way
    - iOS game controller support (needs more generalised implementation)

    - Download a ROM using Mobile Safari and import it into Provenance
- iTunes File Sharing
    - Just drop ROMs into the app from iTunes on your Mac or PC
