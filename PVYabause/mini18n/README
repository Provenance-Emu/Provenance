1 About (ABOU)__________________________________________________________________

mini18n is a translation library under GNU GPL.


2 Compilation (COMP)____________________________________________________________

To compile mini18n, you'll need CMake (>= 2.8) and a C compiler.
GCC, MinGW and Visual C++ are supported, but you may succeed with another
compiler.
mini18n doesn't have any other dependency.

You can either do a in-source build or a out-of-source, aka shadow, build.
The shadow build is the recommended way to build mini18n, but the in-source
build is somewhat easier.


2.1 Shadow build (SHAB)_________________________________________________________

* create a new directory
* on Linux and friends:
  - cd to that newly create directory and run "cmake /path/to/mini18n"
    then "make" and "make install"
* on Windows:
  - open the CMake program
  - set the build directory to your newly created directory
  - set the source directory to the mini18n source dir
  - "configure" then "generate"
  - close CMake and go to the build directory
  - open the mini18n.sln file
  - "build"


2.2 In-source build (INSB)______________________________________________________

* on Linux and friends:
  - from the mini18n source dir, run "cmake ." then "make" and "make install"
* on Windows:
  - open the CMake program
  - set both the build and source directories to the mini18n source dir
  - "configure" then "generate"
  - open the mini18n.sln file
  - "build"
