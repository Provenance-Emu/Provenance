	      etc.).
  + ALL:  Added another accurate 8-bit renderer which is slightly faster and made it
          default.

0.945
  + GP2X: Added frame limiter for frameskipped modes.
  * GP2X: Increased brightness a bit (unused pixel bits now also contain data).
  * GP2X: Suidgehack was not applied correctly (was applied before allocating some
          high memory and had no effect).

0.94
  + Added GP2X port.
  * Improved interrupt timing, Mazin Saga and Burning Force now works.
  * Rewritten renderer code to better suit GP2X, should be faster on other
    ports too.

  + Added emulation of shadow/hilight operator sprites. Other shadow/hilight
    effects are still unemulated.
  + Sprite emulation is more accurate, sprite limit is emulated.
  + Added "accurate sprites" option, which always draws sprites in correct
    order and emulates sprite collision bit, but is significantly slower.

  Emulation changes:
  * Improved interrupt handling, added deferred interrupt emulation
    (Lemmings, etc).
  + Added serial EEPROM SRAM support (Wonder Boy in Monster World,
    Megaman - The Wily Wars and many EA sports games like NBA Jam).
  + Implemented ROM banking for Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers
  * Updated to the latest version of DrZ80 core, integrated memory handlers
    in it for better performance. A noticeable performance increase, but save
	states may not work from the previous version (you can only use them with
	sound disabled in that case).
  + SRAM word read handler was using incorrect byte order, fixed.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0086:
  + Added missing CHK opcode handler (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode handler (Gargoyles,Bubba N Stix,...). As in real genesis,
    memory write-back phase is ignored (but can be enabled in config.h if needed).

0.80
  * Nearly all VDP code was rewritten in ARM asm. Gives ~10-25% performance
    increase (depends on game).
  * Optimized 32-column renderer not to render tiles offscreen, games which
    use 32-column display (like Shining Force) run ~50% faster.
  + Added new "Alternative renderer", which gives another ~30-45% performance
    increase (in addition to mentioned above), but works only with some games,
    because it is missing some features (it uses tile-based rendering
    instead of default line-based and disables H-ints).
  + Added "fit2" display mode for all FC gamers. It always uses 208x146 for
    P800 and 208x208 for all other phones.
  + Added volume control for Motorolas (experimental).

  VDP changes:
  + Added support for vertical window (used by Vapor Trail, Mercs, GRIND
    Stormer and others).
  + Added sprite masking (hiding), adds some speed.
  + Added preliminary H counter emulation. Comix Zone and Sonic 3D Blast
    special stage are now playable.
  + Added column based vertical scrolling (Gunstar Heroes battleship level,
    Sonic and Knuckles lava boss, etc).

  Emulation changes:
  + Re-added and improved Z80 faking when Z80 is disabled. Many games now can
    be played without enabling Z80 (Lost Vikings, Syndicate, etc), but some
    still need it (International Superstar Soccer Deluxe).
  * Improved ym2612 timers, Outrun music plays at correct speed, voices in
    Earthworm Jim play better, more games play sound.
  * I/O registers now remember their values (needed for Pirates! Gold)
  + Added support for 6 button pad.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0083wip:
  + Added missing CHK opcode (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode (Gargoyles). As in real genesis, write-back phase
    is ignored (but is enabled for other systems).

  Backported stuff from Snes9x:
  * Fixed Pxxx jog up/down which were not working in game.
  + Added an option to gzip save states to save space.
  + The emulator now pauses whenever it is loosing focus, so it will now pause
    when alarm/ponecall/battery low/... windows come up.
  - Removed 'pause on phonecall' feature, as it is no longer needed.
  + Video fix for asian A1000s.

0.70
  * Started using tools from "Symbian GCC Improvement Project", which give
    considerable speed increase (~4fps in "center 90" mode).
  * Rewrote some drawing routines in ARM assembly (gives ~6 more fps in
    "center 90" mode).
  * Minor improvement to 0 and 180 "fit" modes. Now they look slightly better
    and are faster.
  * Minor stability improvements (emulator is less likely to crash).
  + Added some background for OSD text for better readability.
  + Added Pal/NTSC detection. This is needed for proper sound speed.
  + Implemented Reesy's DrZ80 Z80 emu. Made some changes to it with hope to make
    it faster.
  + Implemented ym2612 emu from the MAME project. Runs well but sometimes sounds
    a bit weird. Could be a little faster, so made some changes too.
  + Implemented SN76489 emu from the MAME project.
  + Added two separate sound output methods (mediaserver and cmaudiofb) with
    autodetection (needs testing).
  * Fixed VDP DMA fill emulation (as described in Charles MacDonald's docs),
    fixes Contra and some other games.

0.301
  Launcher:
  * Launcher now starts emulation process from current directory,
    not from hardcoded paths.
  * Improved 'pause on call' feature, should hopefully work with Motorola phones.

0.30 (2006-01-07)
  Initial release based on fDave's code.
