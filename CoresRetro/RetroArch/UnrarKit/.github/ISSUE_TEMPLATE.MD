Thanks for making a contribution to UnrarKit! I greatly value issue reports, which help make the library better, and more useful to more people. To help me address your issue, please follow the steps below.

- [ ] Fill out the template below
- [ ] **Option A** is the easier, more traditional way of reporting a bug
- [ ] **Option B** gets you bonus points (redeemable in the form of me looking at your issue more quickly). Create a failing unit test that would pass if the issue were resolved.
