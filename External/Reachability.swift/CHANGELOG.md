## [5.0.0] - 2019-10-19
### Thanks to:  
- @p4checo
- @connorpower

### Changed
- `init()` methods now `throw`
- `ReachabilityError` contains the error code returned by `SCError(`) after an error occurs.
- Renamed error cases to start with lowercase
### Added
- Allow configuring the notification `DispatchQueue`, which was previously hardcoded to `DispatchQueue.main`. It is now an optional, which if set to `nil` will use the notifier's internal queue to fire notifications. The default is still `.main`
### Fixed
- Fixed a crash which could occur if Reachability was deallocated at the same time a system thread was calling back into Reachability
### Deprecated
- To resolve an issue when using optional Reachability vars, `Connection.none` has been deprecated. Use `Connection.unavailable` instead.
